p288: That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.

p269: It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.

p257: It was ugly.

p292: Everything is obviously in the very early stages.
p293: I have got to adopt the same approach.
p227: This represents a tough game for us.

p231: He looks like an Afghan.

NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p225

p376: "We need to chat."
p311: I knew my contract was up this year.

p262: It's a crucial award.

p265: She looked so young.

p245: She is believed to be in South Africa.

p273: Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.

p249: The boy is no longer with us.

p336: Yet therein is the problem.
p278: Must be prepared to use it.

p360: That has now gone.

p341: Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
p226: Is there a new way forward?

p316: We accept the challenge.
p244: Something has to be put in place.

p271: I hate the word.

p343: We've all been here before.
p229: People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.

p318: We are not moving in.

p287: I had come back from London.

p268: However, the purchase is as yet unproven.

p294: I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p233: At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.

p251: We will push.

p317: I feel very sad and extremely cut up.
p310: Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
p364: That is how the Farmer is feeling today.
p333: Nobody else was with me.

p274: People want to see me on the screen.)

p302: Subs not used, McCulloch.
p261: I would love to have him home.

p374: Does that put pressure on us?
p307: Tourism in Scotland is facing a financial disaster.
p247: Merger would be entirely logical.)

p243: Is it worth it ?

p237: It's the only thing.

p258: As she explains.

p262: It is difficult for Ali.

p265: This is a club on the rise.

p245: But it took a lot of bottle.

p297: Bombing is the easy option.
p232: We will push.

p282: It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.

p256: This film will be totally awesome.

p241: This represents a tough game for us.

p340: That was a month ago.
p255: I felt really good until Friday.

p304: Scottish sport was not mentioned.
p329: Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
p246: We will push.

p341: This is a big advantage.
p226: Mexico City was a wonderful experience.

p316: The question is, Will it be enough?
p244: If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.

p271: They said she was stable.

p343: I had troubles with the producers.
p229: I was scared.

p318: We have not had a formal request.
p228: Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.

p279: It will come all right.

p292: The idea has potential for the future.
p293: Clark is back on top form.
p227: If I was a woman.

p335: The failings are serious.
p299: Today is not about contracts.
p252: Something old something new, as it were.

p238: It is about regular committed giving which is the real attraction.

p272: I did not see any reason to change the captain.

p266: A neighbour said.

045
p288: He is too weak to move.

p269: Mexico City was a wonderful experience.

p251: I feel pretty good.

p317: She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
p310: He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.

p281: Among them are many criminals.

p330: Last night they were being comforted by relatives.
p286: I had come back from London.

p326: They say they feel different.
p363: In my experience, he does not do that.
p231: I guess I was lucky, though.

p225: People were determined to change the Government in the last election.

p283: Among them are many criminals.

p264: We're working on it night and day.)

p284: Among them are many criminals.

p345: We would certainly consider the proposals.
p260: Among them are many criminals.

p248: You must always attempt to raise the bar.

p280: Does it matter ?

p376: "It's the same old story."
p311: People acted too quickly.
p339: he told a producer.
p253: They want to be entertained.

p306: They said construction work could begin within weeks.
p274: I had come back from London.)

p302: Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
p261: He will need that machine.

p275: This represents a tough game for us.

p239: Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.

p374: As a player you have to move on.
p307: It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.
p247: Everything is possible in football.)

p243: Does it matter ?

p312: I certainly hope not.
p237: It is so sad.

p258: She looked so young.

p262: The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.

p265: I guess I was lucky, though.

p232: It is urgent.

p282: They want to be entertained.

p256: No meaningful response was issued.

p323: The first was excluding Sinn Fein.
p240: On this showing, they should stick with the lads.

p277: He's just in it for himself.

p308: Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
p334: And we're not there yet.
p234: All businesses continue to trade.

p303: Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p273: We have to look beyond the very short term.

p249: Is a drug dealer?

p336: That, though, was just the start of it.
p278: Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?

p360: This will take up to nine months.
p254: No meaningful response was issued.

p285: He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.

p295: Everything is possible in football.
p250: Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?

p236: We are working on it.

p351: You had to go and see him.
p301: It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.
p259: Among them are many criminals.)

p361: He was found again almost a year later.
p263: It seemed the tough times were behind him.

p347: How many cases have there been?
p241: We need to chat.

p340: I have lost all confidence.
p255: She looked so young.

p304: I was doing a charity concert.
p329: I hope you will leave it at that.
p246: Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.

p341: Her daughter is getting married.
p226: This represents a tough game for us.

p316: After that it is up to the boss.
p244: They are going after them.

p271: Among them are many criminals.

p343: So, it took me back to boarding school.
p229: It will come all right.

p318: I never had a childhood.
p228: Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.

p279: It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.

p292: I did not concentrate on my performance.
p293: He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
p227: He was a home referee.

p335: The prognosis is excellent.
p299: It should be a great game, though.

p238: This represents a tough game for us.

p272: He's just in it for himself.

p266: Among them are many criminals.

p230: If not, he should go home.

p287: For the meantime, though, the signs are good.

p268: Something has to give sometime.

p294: Who was the mystery MP?
p233: The man became a reporter.

p251: That should do it.

p317: I would think they are just behind them.
p310: And who would argue with that?
p364: So what did he do?
p333: It does make a big difference.
p281: The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.

p330: They said we were out of touch.
p286: Pulled a huge number of viewers.

p326: It is a good result for Great Britain.
p363: That is good news.
p231: I was inspired by two things.

p225: No details of the talks were given.

p283: I was released after six days.

p267: Pulled a huge number of viewers.

p305: They receive a high profile in the media.

p284: It is marvellous.

p345: I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p260: It is marvellous.

p248: No meaningful response was issued.

p280: How do you take them away ?

p376: "That should do it."
p311: My heart is with the artist.
p339: That is not the place for her.

p306: We will continue to operate within the sport.
p274: Pulled a huge number of viewers.)

p302: He could face a jail sentence.
p261: It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.

p275: Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.

p239: But not a penny has been paid.

p374: It is so out of character.
p307: She added, It is the same story in both countries.
p247: It's not a swimming pool out there.)

p243: How do you take them away ?

p298: I did not want any damage to us.
p312: However, there could be more bad weather to come.
p237: There will be no shortage of quality applicants.

p258: He looks like an Afghan.

p262: I was angry.

p265: There was no safety net.

p245: Mexico City was a wonderful experience.

p297: Except for this, it was offside.

p282: It's the only thing.

p256: That period was a struggle.

p323: Horses are drawn by ballot.
p240: You must always attempt to raise the bar.

p277: However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.

p308: He could face a jail sentence.

p234: The man became a reporter.

p303: I did not want any damage to us.
p273: The drivers had an awful lot of verbal abuse.

p249: As she explains.

p336: My office is down there.
p278: How are you, sir ?

p360: And maybe they have.
p254: That period was a struggle.

p285: He looks like an Afghan.

p295: I'm sure he didn't mean it.
p250: How are you, sir ?

p236: He looks like an Afghan.

p351: What did you learn in school today?
p301: She added, It is the same story in both countries.
p259: Merger would be entirely logical.)

p361: The answer was wrong.
p263: That company should not be allowed to operate in this country.

p347: Peter, of course, refuses to conform.
p241: That time has passed.

p340: It would be another reason to live.
p255: Life is good.

p304: You have to have a sense of humour.
p329: We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p246: They said she was stable.

p341: Moray Council could not be contacted last night.

p293: Lothian and Borders Police are also involved.
p227: There was no safety net.

p335: Rangers deserved to beat us.
p299: That says something for his strength of character.
p252: They seem too much of a sure thing.

p238: Separate approvals would be needed for these.

p272: However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.

p266: Is a drug dealer?

047
p288: He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.

p269: Who can say?

p313: We offered something different.

p314: I only half believe it.
p230: I must take a seat.

p287: There was no safety net.

p268: Her husband had been waiting for her return.

p294: This was no accident.
p233: It depends on the decisions of the member states.

p310: I hope you will leave it at that.
p364: We must not give in to bastards.
p333: Do not forget about Monaco.

p286: I had trouble with the producers.

p326: What on earth is wrong with you?
p363: This has come as a shock to everyone.
p231: A win is a win.

NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p225

p305: They were urged to get themselves in order.
p270: I had trouble with the producers.

p362: I am so upset.
p264: The results, out tomorrow, will focus on the company's strategy.)

p284: Every aspect of our play was first class.

p345: His record with England was not good.
p260: Every aspect of our play was first class.

p248: It is urgent.

p311: That fight begins today for freedom and liberty.
p339: The jury is still out on this one.
p253: You had better believe it.

p306: But the law is very clear on this.

p302: They don't take you to mass graves.

p312: I feel pretty good.
p237: It is urgent.

p258: It is the whole package.

p262: It has been a horrible, horrible time.

p297: After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p232: It is difficult for Ali.

p282: You had better believe it.

p256: A neighbour said.

p323: We have our supporters and our enemies.
p240: It is so sad.

p277: It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.

p308: They don't take you to mass graves.
p334: And the funny thing is, they usually do.
p234: It depends on the decisions of the member states.

p303: It was an easy decision to come here.
p273: I expect a rapid response.

p249: He is too weak to move.

p336: There can be no dispute about our history.
p278: So is that it, then ?

p360: Next league matches, Dundee United Rangers.
p254: I am just going to go for it.

p285: No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.

NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p295

p236: Everything else is a bonus.

p351: We know we can defend it.

p361: They need to be helped.

p341: If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.
p226: We need to chat.

p316: It doesn't have to be in Inverness.
p244: The whole thing is the music.

p271: There is no reason at all.

p343: That's what we're trying to achieve.
p229: But it is all by design.

p318: We offered something different.
p228: We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.

p279: That period was a struggle.

p276: Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.

p257: The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.

p292: Structural changes were also required.
p293: That was the theory, anyway.
p227: The casting of her husband was an accident.

p335: That, though, is the measure of the man.
p299: You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.

p238: They have shown a great desire and attitude.

p272: It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.

p314: It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p230: It was bound to happen.

p287: The teacher would have approved.

p268: You must always attempt to raise the bar.

p294: I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.

p237: I feel pretty good.

p258: I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.

p262: They had to explain it.

p265: I expect a rapid response.

p245: We need to chat.

p297: What do we do for an encore?
p232: But it might have done.

p282: Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.

p256: It's a crucial award.

p323: Mackie was at home, unable to watch.
p240: That period was a struggle.

p286: We are certainly talking about many millions.

p326: His art was not just about emotions.
p363: I was not overly concerned about this.
p231: There's nothing we could do about this.

p225: I have learned from him.

p283: No details of the talks were given.

p267: They just thought it was extremely good acting.

p305: Here is a tale of devotion to duty.
p270: My fitness was very poor.

p362: They finished second and third.
p264: I only signed this morning.)

p284: Here's a clue.

p345: Who would be a referee?

p248: The record companies have gone through the floor.

p280: Has the conflict started ?

p376: "A recording contract is on the horizon."

p306: It is also central to the unfolding drama.
p274: We are certainly talking about many millions.)

p302: Happily we found it in the library.
p261: For the meantime, though, the signs are good.

p275: He looks like an Afghan.

p239: We must learn to finish.

p374: His condition was serious but stable.
p307: Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p247: Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.)

p237: We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.

p258: We were surprised to see the photograph.

p336: It was a joy.
p278: He will need that machine.

p360: But we are confident.
p254: This represents a tough game for us.

p285: I was lost.

p304: I hadn't been looking after myself.
p329: They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.
p246: The State would provide.

p341: Today is not about contracts.
p226: But it might have done.

p316: So, why does he do it?
p244: That is still the case.

p271: They were on holiday in Egypt.

p343: I have no doubt about that.
NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p229
p318: He was critically ill in hospital last night.
p228: But it might have done.

p279: It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.

p276: Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.

p257: Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.

p292: The racist abuse was terrible.
p293: This is thought to mean sometime next week.

p272: Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.

p266: No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.

p313: My brother's buried under there.
p300: Except for this, it was offside.
p314: We have no choice but to shut down.
p230: In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.

p287: We have to look beyond the very short term.

p268: The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.

p294: In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p233: The strategy is not without risk.

p251: It is the whole package.

p317: He did the right thing by ignoring me.
p310: Again, that was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p364: What do you think they said?
p333: Everything was an effort.
p281: I had come back from London.

p330: There will be widespread support on all sides.
p286: We are a new department.

p326: They are all bright and different.
p363: He was very grateful for his health.
p231: It is a symbolic concert.

p362: But this was refused.
p264: The Office is a show about nothing, then.)

p284: Her body was found about four miles from the car.

p345: Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.
p260: Her body was found about four miles from the car.

p248: We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.

p280: Have I really come to this ?

p376: "It has been a horrible, horrible time."
p311: They are already on the way there.
p339: It is a hard act to follow, the Winning act.
p253: A neighbour said.

p306: Except for this, it was offside.
p274: The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.)

p302: I know a lot of people who don't.
p261: There was no safety net.

p275: Here's a clue.

p239: You must always attempt to raise the bar.

p374: He had reason to be pleased.
p307: There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
p247: The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.)

p243: Have I really come to this ?

p298: I saw them not long after it happened.
p312: Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p237: It is bizarre.

p258: That's the day job.

p262: We were surprised to see the photograph.

p265: Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.

p245: Who can say?

p297: At the time, he was a living legend.
p232: They had to explain it.

p282: A neighbour said.

p256: It's a blessing.

p323: We have been let down by these people.
p240: Who can say?

p277: This represents a tough game for us.

p308: I know a lot of people who don't.
p334: We feel it sends out the wrong message.
p234: The strategy is not without risk.

p303: I saw them not long after it happened.
p273: How are you, sir ?

p249: He looks like an Afghan.

p336: It's the same with cinema.
p278: I have learned from him.

p360: It is like a football team.
p254: It's a crucial award.

p285: It's a miracle.

p295: He declined to give further details.
p250: Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.

p236: I haven't been ill at all.

p351: Instead we were shot in the back.
p301: There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
p259: Pulled a huge number of viewers.)

p361: It is the tip of the iceberg.

p244: At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.

p343: It is a beautiful country.
p229: We need to chat.

p318: My brother is buried under there.
p228: Hopefully, it will be built by next year.

p279: The judge said.

p276: But not a penny has been paid.

p257: He had no enemies.

p292: What is the new religion?
p293: In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p227: That is very hard, alone.

p335: But he just carried on anyway.
p299: I've just got to do this.
p252: The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.

p238: The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.

p272: This represents a tough game for us.

p266: There was a substantial explosion.

051
p288: I was inspired by two things.

p269: Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.

p313: Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p300: On the contrary, some of the music is very expensive.
p314: I'm feeling pretty good.
p230: I have made that offer.

p287: It depends on the couple.

p268: The man became a reporter.

p294: Hopefully, that'll come from someone on our side.
p233: But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.

p251: He had no enemies.

p317: These men are a part of India.
p310: Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.

p286: He also presented You Bet!

p326: I found a fault and worked at it.
p363: The nation has his music.
p231: We keep an eye on it.

p225: We are committed to the ban.

p283: It also opened a branch in Livingston.

p267: The City welcomed the brighter outlook.

p305: In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p270: What do they want us to do ?

p362: Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.
p264: We were leading by two goals.)

p284: I was inspired by two things.

p345: It was time to act.

p248: But it might have done.

p280: I'm as fit as I can get.

p376: "He looks like an Afghan."

p339: It means it is difficult.
p253: It is bizarre.

p306: On the contrary, some of the music is very expensive.
p274: The drivers had an awful lot of verbal abuse.)

p302: There was nobody on the roof.
p261: I must take a seat.

p275: I had come back from London.

p239: New York is my home.

p374: We have a problem.
p307: It was, however, the wrong side.
p247: We would have concerns about suspension.)

p243: I'm as fit as I can get.

p298: This guy is never going to give up.
p312: I was in the zone in the morning.
p237: That should do it.

p258: We have not given up hope.

p262: Next league matches Celtic.

p265: The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.

p245: It's a blessing.

p297: I would like to stay with Rangers.
p232: Here's a clue.

p282: It is bizarre.

p256: Is a drug dealer?

p323: What's it for?
p240: It's a blessing.

p277: It is bizarre.

p308: There was nobody on the roof.
p334: Later we discovered it was a hoax.
p234: But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.

p303: This guy is never going to give up.
p273: So is that it, then ?

p249: No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.

p336: It was the climax of the thing.
p278: I had trouble with the producers.

p360: When he came to see me on Monday.
p254: We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.

p285: I love the Dome.

p295: I think it was entirely the right decision.
p250: Strikers like to go to the ground.

p236: They just thought it was extremely good acting.

p351: This isn't a gimmick.
p301: It was, however, the wrong side.
p259: I had trouble with the producers.)

p361: They were taken to prove a point.
p263: I would love to have him home.

p347: George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p241: He looks like an Afghan.

p340: This has been a difficult time for me.
p255: Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.

p304: But they also came with a downside.
p329: I didn't have a clue.
p246: Every aspect of our play was first class.

p341: We are going for it.
p226: It has been a horrible, horrible time.

p316: It is very unfair, and something should be done.
p244: In my view, it has to be done.

p271: No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.

p343: I expect a rapid response.
p229: It is difficult for Ali.

p318: Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p228: Mary Archer is almost too clever.

p292: Five officers were injured.
p293: Stealing from the benefits system is no different.
p227: The motive for the shooting was not known.

p272: It is bizarre.

p266: Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.

052
p288: Sadly, it can't.

p269: It's very odd.

p313: What were they?

p330: He has one son and one daughter.
p286: Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?

p326: My position on the euro is quite clear.
p363: But real life is not like that.
p231: We have not given up hope.

p225: Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.

p283: I would say the position is open.

p267: I must take a seat.

p305: Some US embassy staff have left the country.
p270: Is it worth it ?

p280: We took part in a festival called Global Dance.

p376: "They had to explain it."

p273: Let's hope that it does.

p249: It happens from time to time.

p317: The father was treated like a criminal, and why?
p310: All of us know it exists.
p364: Partly, it is his own fault.

p347: It will come up here.
p241: What was the main difference?

p340: It needs a rethink.

p304: I have great respect for all my players.

p269: You do not change overnight.

p313: In a way he was.
p300: Mr Cook, a left-winger from Britain, would be ideally placed.
p314: But he just carried on anyway.
p230: It was exactly four months away.

p287: How are you, sir ?

p268: It was just too much for us.

p233: For the meantime, though, the signs are good.

p251: Four other charges were dropped.

p317: I am a drug addict.
p310: Moray Council could not be contacted last night.

p330: I think they should have more respect.
p286: We have not given up hope.

p326: It is the wealthiest in Europe.
p363: We were upset about the referee.
p231: We should be able to cope.

p225: However, the problem is the timing.

p283: Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?

p267: It's just the timing of the game.

p305: This film will be totally awesome.
p270: The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.

p362: It is a sign of hope.
p264: What do we do?)

p284: There's a danger.

p345: I've never seen anything like it.
p260: There's a danger.

p248: It's very odd.

p280: You must always attempt to raise the bar.

p376: "This is a step backwards."
p311: I just went a bit too far.
p339: We need to do that every week.
p253: For the meantime, though, the signs are good.

p306: Mr Cook, a left-winger from Britain, would be ideally replaced.
p274: We will pay their bills.)

p302: We must improve our relations with the government.
p261: How are you, sir ?

p275: George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.

p239: Among them are many criminals.

p374: The net is closing.
p307: The encounter was to change his life.
p247: How are you, sir ?)

p243: You must always attempt to raise the bar.

p298: In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p312: The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
p237: For the meantime, though, the signs are good.

p258: It should be devolved.

p262: Jobs could go.

p265: He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.

p245: It's a matter of balance.

p297: You just have to accept.
p232: This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.

p282: For the meantime, though, the signs are good.

p256: It is unique.

p323: We didn't try hard enough, that is all.
p240: However the drama was still not at an end.

p277: No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.

p308: We must improve our relations with government.
p334: Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p234: For the meantime, though, the signs are good.

p303: In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p273: We will pay their bills.

p249: It is unique.

p336: This ruling is a farce.
p278: Let's hope that it does.

p360: As for the warning, it was not needed.
p254: He is too weak to move.

p285: It's that kind of place.

p295: A formal decision will be announced within months.
p250: She said she was really sorry.

p236: You should consider whether you want to be in this film.

p351: The jury is still out.
p301: The encounter was to change his life.
p259: We have to keep our clients.)

p361: This resulted in the following.
p263: I've got to provide for my family.

p347: From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p241: I was an athlete.

p340: Why does it work?
p255: There will be tough opponents to this report.

p304: His track record is not promising.
p329: I have had no social life at all.
p246: I feel I did not have enough time.

p341: Labour accused the Tory leader of panicking.
p226: Next league matches Celtic.

p316: However, he said it would be likely to bring a chill.
p244: This trend is likely to strengthen.

p271: It's so awful.

p343: The matter will come up again.
p229: What was the main difference ?

p318: In a way he was.
p228: That's the truth.

p279: He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.

p276: And they removed a Borderer.

p257: It is not great art.

p292: We're in a state of shock and disbelief.
p293: The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p227: Do I have a favourite ?

p335: Let's see that increase over the years.
p299: They were not doing it too well, either.
p252: I agree with you about this.

p238: Have I really come to this ?

p272: No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.

p266: There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.

p314: The spirit in the squad is certainly good.
p230: He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.

p287: So is that it, then ?

p268: Perhaps we should do the same.

p294: We are only human.
p233: There was no safety net.

p251: It's a real challenge.

p317: I've had to take time off work today.
p310: This is the band.
p364: The family is so happy for him.
p333: It will come up here.
p281: It was a lovely experience.

p330: Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p286: The cuts were made within an hour of each other.

p326: This is all part of opening the door.
p363: That is our objective.
p231: Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?

p225: But retail banking would be run from Halifax.

p283: How are you, sir ?

p267: Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.

p305: Three further cases were confirmed yesterday in Scotland.

p264: Why do it otherwise?)

p284: We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.

p345: They were willing us to get a second.
p260: We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.

p248: It will take time.

p280: We just want this season to end.

p302: Within six minutes, they were two goals down.

p239: That's been the difference between the sides.

p374: I cannot believe she has been admonished.
p307: It's the best of both worlds.
p247: So is that it, then ?)

p243: We just want this season to end.

p298: The partnership was set up during the summer.
p312: The trust has no magic wand.
p237: We were surprised to see the photograph.

p258: We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.

p262: And a film maker was born.

p265: Robin Williams is very subdued.

p245: There will be tough opponents to this report.

p282: My fitness was very poor.

p256: It is not a process which can be completed overnight.

p323: It also condemned the suicide bombers.
p240: For the meantime, though, the signs are good.

p334: It was totally my fault.
p234: There was no safety net.

p303: The partnership was set up during the summer.
p273: It was exactly four months away.

p249: It will take time.

p336: They enjoy playing the game.

p360: The incidents are not believed to be linked.
p254: Life is good.

p347: Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
p241: There was a battle there.

p340: He would have been wrong.
p255: Equity declined to comment.

p304: For a moment it was all about her.
p329: Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p246: The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.

p341: I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.
p226: She's a spy!

p316: It doesn't look as pretty.
p244: For the meantime, though, the signs are good.

p271: It is unique.

p343: I don't believe in gesture politics.
p229: My mother is a widow.

p318: It's back to how it used to be.
p228: That is very hard, alone.

p279: Life is good.

p276: He is too weak to move.

p257: George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.

p292: I was completely knackered.
p293: In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p227: What do we do ?

p335: I've learned a lot, and tomorrow is another day.
p299: He added, It's not a racial problem.
p252: Or so he thought.

p238: They desperately want some stability.

p272: Here's a clue.

p266: We should have known.

060

p230: It's not covered by the insurance.

p287: Do I have a favourite ?

p268: They desperately want some stability.

p294: I went with the mood.
p233: He looks as if he could be worth the risk.

p251: It is not great art.

p317: The problem is the book.
p310: She has a wonderful mind.
p364: Why has it taken so long?
p333: From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p281: Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.

p330: This is a big club.
p286: We would have concerns about suspension.

p326: Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
p363: What's the problem?
NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p231
p225: Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.

p283: So is that it, then ?

p267: We need to increase the membership.

p305: There is no mandate for a regime change.

p362: They're interested only in profits.
p264: What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?)

p284: Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.

p345: No casualties were reported.
p260: Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.

p245: Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.

p297: The tribunal continues today.
p232: That is very hard, alone.

p282: Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.

p256: That's the truth.

p323: I think that's a bit of an invasion.
p240: That's the truth.

p277: It had been in place since last July.

p308: Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p334: Or so everyone believed.
p234: He looks as if he could be worth the risk.

p303: Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p273: Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.

p249: That's the truth.

p336: It was rather a distorted image of Islam.
p278: It was exactly four months away.

p360: But there is no easy option.
p254: It is the whole package.

p285: There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.

p347: It is a very special city.
NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p241
p340: He played really, really well.
p255: Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.

p304: Sadly, the game will never see his like again.
p329: In short, the club was broke.
p246: Scotland had great assets.

p341: I think it is a sensible change.
p226: It is unique.

p316: However, our players will fight for that.
p244: We have got to deliver.

p271: I expect a rapid response.

p343: The decision is purely down to the clinic.
p229: And a film maker was born.

p318: It is not a standing army.
p228: He will now seek to sell his shares in the club.

p279: We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.

p276: Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.

p257: There was a battle there.

p292: There are two interests in this woodland.
p293: But the foundations have been laid.
p227: The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.

p335: These findings would be made public.

061
p288: They're appalled by that.

p269: There was a battle there.

p313: The firm was down and almost out.
p300: It's all too short term.
p314: I would not want to be young again.
p230: But the challenge is in the US.

p287: What do we do ?

p268: Everything is possible in football.

p294: I think we'll just keep it.
p233: You have to be patient.

p251: They're appalled by that.

p317: There was no basis for their arrest.
p310: There are just two tournaments remaining.
p364: No-one knows the numbers.
p333: Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
p281: We will pay their bills.

p330: I find it rather oppressive.

p326: Mr Blunkett was convinced.
p363: He is not alone.
p231: So is that it, then ?

p225: Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.

p283: Do I have a favourite ?

p267: He was at home with his pals.

p305: He did the right thing by ignoring me.

p362: And there has been a good start.
p264: So, did she meet him?)

p284: George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.

p345: The classes are taking place.

p297: Basically, the classical tradition won out.
p232: The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.

p282: It is unique.

p256: That is very hard, alone.

p351: We are not the first to be affected.
p301: That is why we want this decision reversed.

p347: This is only the start of my season.
p241: It was all in a short period of time.

p340: He was right of course.
p255: Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.

p304: Trading Places was too obvious.
p329: His charisma is all on the course.
p246: It's that kind of place.

p341: Sex is fun?
p226: It is not a process which can be completed overnight.

p316: Everyone was very saddened.

p287: It has been an amazing day.

p268: He looks like an Afghan.

p294: Debate is not just talk.
p233: That is all in the past.

p251: It's that kind of place.

p317: This wasn't just a big crowd.
p310: We're into that build-up now.
p364: You make the choice.
p333: The chief constable is right.
p281: Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.

p330: Many, many people don't know who he is.

p326: For the other parties, it is back to business as usual.
p363: He did that last Sunday.
p231: Do I have a favourite ?

p225: I was very pleased with them today, though.

p283: What do we do ?

p267: They are in the euro.

p305: That tells you something about them.
p270: We have made a commitment to those people.

p362: I feel my parents are in New York.
p264: It happens from time to time.)

p284: It's that kind of place.

p345: If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p260: It's that kind of place.

p248: Four other charges were dropped.

p280: The referee is there to decide these things.

NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p376

p339: Hopefully it will be tomorrow night.
p253: I expect a rapid response.

p306: This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.
p274: It's not covered by the insurance.)

p302: He said it was the worst possible result.
p261: I wish I had put on a brighter tie.

p275: There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.

p239: Perhaps we should do the same.

p374: This year the exercise is being repeated.
p307: It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
p247: Why do it otherwise ?)

p243: The referee is there to decide these things.

p312: The rest, of course, is history.
p237: None has ever been found.

p258: Sounds like The Sixth Sense?

p262: There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.

NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p265

p301: It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
p259: He hadn't had them for a long time.)

p361: It is not for me to say.
p263: Indeed, it is only the beginning.

p347: The message is just not getting through.
p241: Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.

p340: It's there for people to look at.

p292: Last night, the row continued.
p293: So they will settle again.
p227: They have to come up with a solution.

p335: I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.
p299: It was created by genocide.
p252: For a decade she was proved right.

p238: He looks like an Afghan.

p272: There was no safety net.

p266: Try to save us.

063
p288: Equity declined to comment.

p269: It's that kind of place.

p313: I was chosen to do this.

p341: It is time to give her a rest.

p329: His treatment has been quite atrocious.
p246: But I was wrong.

p341: Israel has done very little until now.
p226: It's just awful.

p227: For once, you should believe the hype.

p335: First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p299: We certainly will need to watch him.
p252: Put simply, it goes something like this.

p238: Final proposals will be published in February.

p272: By then, he was walking on water.

p266: That deal will be decided under the existing rules.

093
p288: They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.

p269: Today I couldn't run on it.

p313: There's also the point.
p300: But the relief was short-lived.
p314: Action must be taken urgently.
p230: But I know the course.

p287: Before the game we went for a pint.

p268: Final proposals will be published in February.

p294: But now it's back to golf.

p333: It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.
p281: I wish I had put on a brighter tie.

p330: This will be great for the young lads.
p286: So, did she meet him ?

p326: This time, there were no such rewards.
p363: I'd never be satisfied with just the relay.
p231: We must stop it with the golf ball.

NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p225
p283: We have to offer value for money.

p267: While they went on holiday, we got the contract.

p305: You've got it coming Kabul.
p270: The move follows a review of the Singapore

p362: Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p264: Are you going to win?)

p284: Then came the crunch.

p345: It's about time something was done about equipment.
p260: Then came the crunch.

p248: He was possessed

p280: They had the appeal of TV stars.

p376: "Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom."
p311: It is set in Paris.
p339: We did it in one take.
p253: This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.

p306: But the relief was short-lived.
p274: It was a family tragedy.)

p302: That was a hard game to play in, very tough.
p261: But it is up again.

p275: Hartley should know.

p239: George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.

p374: It doesn't always work that way.

p237: We must look forward.

p258: Journalists should make him.

p262: I wish I had put on a brighter tie.

p265: May not have been at fault?

p245: It was some time before she found out he was safe.

p297: I sincerely hope not.
p232: However, it did not end that way.

p282: This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.

p256: That will come after the game on Saturday.

p323: Scotland came very close in the second Test.
p240: We could not get any possession.

p277: It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.

p308: That was a hard game to play in, very tough.
p334: There are a lot of unanswered questions.
p234: He is in the US.

p303: He didn't have time for any other hobbies.
p273: Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.

p249: And rugby fans can help.

p336: When is it ever anything else?
p278: It was some time before she found out he was safe.

p360: That's what makes it interesting.
p254: He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.

p285: It was mayhem.

p340: The teenager had been missing for six months.
p255: If you could find it.

p246: It is home-grown.

p341: Debate was impassioned and furious.
p226: It's never too late.

p316: It's a much bigger problem.
p244: However, a ruling will not come before next week.

p271: Maloney is an engaging talent.

p343: They were going through the motions, but that's about all.
p229: Well, the big day has arrived.

p335: We wanted it left for a wee while.
p299: I don't think it could be clearer.
p252: Even if he doesn't have any lines.

p238: He seems to have everything.

p272: It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.

p266: Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.

094

p269: They've got to account for it.

p300: You had better believe it.
p314: They are completely different from each other.

p251: If you could find it.

p317: He was critically ill in hospital last night.
p310: I agree with them.

p333: Subs not used, McCulloch.
p281: The conclusion is the same.

p330: He needed seven hours of surgery.
p286: So what is the campaign about ?

p326: That'd be good for the whole city.
p363: What has happened?
p231: You are like an animal.

p225: That's as it should be.

p283: It's so hard to shift.

p267: It's not a lack of effort.

p305: Alan Milburn, the health secretary, refused to comment.
p270: However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.

p362: Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.
p264: What is the wife?)

p284: It is annoying.

p345: It was a funny feeling.
p260: It is annoying.

p248: I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.

p280: There is no issue of national security involved here.

p376: "The selection process is still at a very early stage."
p311: The party has never fully recovered.
p339: He doesn't even know who he is.
NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p253

p237: I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.

p258: But it was a pleasure.

p265: They tried to deny it.

p245: We want to get to the final, anyway.

p297: Broomfield was the centre of the town.
p232: This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.

p282: Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.

p256: A council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue.

p285: Journalists should make him.

p295: I'm not thinking too much about the tour.

p241: Motherwell have no such good fortune.

p340: I'm delighted to be coming back home.
p255: The selection process is still at a very early stage.

p304: He was jailed for five years.
p329: Nothing like this has ever happened here before.
p246: I saw the whole thing.

p341: We are losing this war.
p226: Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.

p316: There are no problems between us at all.
p244: It is not a story.

p271: He was possessed

p343: It is par for the course, of course.
p229: I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.

p318: It was forced to divert.
p228: This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.

p279: Yet, it worked.

p276: We should all be grateful.

p313: Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
p300: The mood is upbeat.
p314: The money is not really our concern.
p230: We intend to change the model.

p287: It would be the end of farming.

p268: So, did she meet him ?

p294: Was it a signal?
p233: By then, he was walking on water.

p251: Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.

p317: However, it is much bigger than that.
p310: I feel very strongly about that.
p364: It was good to score the goal today.
p333: Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
p281: It is a vicious circle.

p330: Who said impatience is a virtue?
p286: And does it ?

p326: It is, honestly, difficult to write about this.
p363: If they are not, the commission will take action.
p231: This is the logic of punishment assaults.

NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p225
p283: They lived for their children.

p267: That means an extra two years.

p305: We will have to see, but it makes you think.
p270: We should recognise that others have done a good job.

p362: Sure, this is a very important event for me.
NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p264
p284: I love the Dome.

p345: He was at it again yesterday.
p260: I love the Dome.

p248: Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.

p280: He will be a very hard act to follow.

p376: "Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights."
p311: Everyone is working together to resolve the problems.
p339: It is hard to understand.
p253: Yet, it worked.

p306: The mood is upbeat.
p274: It is for policy Ministers to defend their policies.)

p302: There was an element of jealousy.
p261: You are like an animal.

p275: May not have been at fault?

p239: It was fun, but not a living.

p374: That, though, is not true.
p307: I have no plans to change the oath.
p247: Potions said he would drive.)

p243: He will be a very hard act to follow.

p298: The Premier League has been a huge success.
p312: It will be a challenging film.
p237: Until you hit the big games.

p258: We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.

p262: FOR once, you should believe the hype.

p265: We have an election in eight days.

p245: Oil embargo endorsed.

p297: There is no such thing.
p232: I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.

p282: Yet, it worked.

p240: It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.

p277: Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.

p308: There was an element of jealousy.

p273: We intend to change the model.

p249: The city council is a major property owner in the area.

p336: I believe in trade unions.
p278: That time is not now, however.

p360: It's not a game.
p254: He seems to be pleased with the picture.

p285: It is a love affair.

p295: I had some time with Aston Villa.
p250: It is high time to act.

p236: I had a ball today.

p351: Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.
p301: I have no plans to change the oath.
p259: The allegations were still under investigation, he added.)

p361: If it's going in, it goes in.
p263: It might change your life.

p347: We gave them the goal.
p241: That deal will be decided under the existing rules.

p340: He said he never saw it.
p255: It is a delight on every level.

p304: I am about protecting the state pension.
p329: It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
p246: Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.

p341: It's a difficult one to play.
p226: That will come after the game on Saturday.

p316: Hopefully, he will be back in contention next week.
p244: However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.

p271: I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.

p343: And so it goes on.
p229: Until you hit the big games.

p318: Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
p228: Safety was also an issue.

p279: This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.

p276: He's not getting into any games.

p257: Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.

p292: They should come clean.
p293: Her presence was almost everywhere.
p227: You are like an animal.

p335: These guys will not lie down.
p299: Our offer will remain on the table.
p252: It looks that way.

p238: It wasn't possible to relax.

p272: Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.

p266: We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.

096
p288: It was a good performance.

p269: Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.

p313: That's the National Grid.
p300: He told us about it the next day.
p314: Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
p230: It was some time before she found out he was safe.

p287: It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.

p268: So what is the campaign about ?

p294: It may not even be possible.
p233: I had a bit in hand.

p251: Journalists should make him.

p317: One season, they might do well.
p310: Now he will have to start again.
p364: Allison is not convinced.
p333: He could face a jail sentence.
p281: But I know the course.

p330: What do we do for an encore?
p286: Are you from the rugby ?

p326: We are very very proud of Alain.
p363: Where will the money come from?
NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p231

p267: Then came the collision with Sergio.

p305: We must keep our feet on the ground.
p270: It was some time before she found out he was safe.

p362: They have to work so hard.
p264: What do we want to do that for?)

p284: We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.

p345: You can't go on forever.
p260: We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.

p248: It is a delight on every level.

p280: Earlier, both main parties agreed a crucial stage had been reached.

p376: "It was mayhem."
p311: Surely history will not repeat itself.
p339: What will it be?
p253: He's been hit by it.

p306: They told us about it the next day.
p274: In the end we made too many errors.)

p302: Craig is still suffering seizures.
p261: The move follows a review of the Singapore

p275: Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.

p239: Kenny Miller might come through.

p374: I'm working at the moment.
p307: We did not even get a free kick.
p247: The woman is basically off her head.)

p243: Earlier, both main parties had agreed a crucial stage had been reached.

p298: The League of Nations was also his idea.
p312: The test case is still awaiting action.
p237: We could not get any possession.

p258: Oil embargo endorsed.

p262: Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.

p265: Oil embargo endorsed.

p245: No date has been set for the appeal.

p297: However, their reaction could not have been more different.
p232: Then came the crunch.

p282: He's been hit by it.

p256: I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.

p323: There is no conflict of interest.
p240: They were outside the circle.

p277: They lived for their children.

p308: Craig is still suffering seizures.
p334: It was a foolhardy decision.
p234: I had a bit in hand.

p303: The League of Nations was also his idea.
p273: We should recognise that others have done a good job.

p249: Now the system is right behind us.

p336: Sub Not Used, Mackay.
p278: We created so many chances.

p360: Buildings are about people.
p254: All options are open.

p285: However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.

p295: We recognise it as a key area.
p250: Why do it otherwise ?

p236: He refused to name the survivors.

p351: Surely this is not supposed to happen?
p301: We did not even get a free kick.
p259: We would have concerns about that.)

p361: Nobody called me to explain.
p263: No-one in the passenger train was hurt.

p347: They don't take you to mass graves.
p241: The peace process will be buried!

p340: It is a matter of clarity.
p255: Get to know him.

p304: We will look into it.
p329: Jamming would be equally difficult.
p246: However, we have not come to any conclusions.

p341: The death rates are still as high.
p226: However, it did not end that way.

p316: I've had it for the exams.
p244: He is in the US.

p271: This one did.

p343: The winner will be announced next month.
p229: The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.

p318: That's the National Grid.
p228: It is an old family habit.

p279: It is an old family habit.

p276: The coach is a man who is very ambitious.

p257: The peace process will be buried!

p292: Let's see that increase over the years.
p293: But the cost to his health was enormous.
p227: No, the equipment is extra.

p335: I would think they are just behind them.
p299: We are trying to establish a date.
p252: Now comes the hard part.

p238: He was at home with his pals.

p272: They lived for their children.

p266: I wish I had put on a brighter tie.

097
p288: Here, again, they were denied a voice.

p269: Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.

p313: But Allen is deadly serious.
p300: It's not a new concept in jazz.
p314: Correction, knowing him, he might.
p230: Two of the team became ill.

p287: It's not a lack of confidence.

p268: And does it ?

p294: In fact, they go hand in hand.
p233: We have to have a full statement to Parliament.

p251: They were outside the circle.

p317: Our approach will be different.
p310: It is a difficult thing to explain.
p364: He felt there was no case to answer.
p333: They didn't take you to mass graves.
p281: We must stop it with the golf ball.

p330: Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p286: Had I heard ?

p326: Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
p363: She is still very poorly.
p231: We should recognise others have done a good job.

NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p225
p283: The trick is to try it.

p267: It is a total and utter change of culture.

p305: My grandparents were terrified.
p270: But the battle has only just begun.

p362: Well, was it?
p264: Does the name matter?)

p284: I am extremely sad.

p345: So far this season this approach is working.
p260: I am extremely sad.

p248: I had a ball today.

p280: Put simply, it goes something like this.

p376: "But it was a pleasure."
p311: The initial report has been completed.
p339: The search is due to be completed today.
p253: I love the Dome.

p306: It's not a new concept in jazz.
p274: The following are the principal provisions.)

p261: If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.

p275: We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.

p239: Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.

p374: However, this is only the start.
p307: He was married with a young child.
p247: I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.)

p243: Put simply, it goes something like this.

p298: I've done it almost like a variety show.
p312: What happens next?
p237: I love the Dome.

p258: It is a good lifestyle.

p262: It is a good day for the coalition.

p265: He takes the job.

p245: It was an adventure.

p297: I was doing well at the hustings.
p232: The oil companies would be asked to contribute.

p282: I love the Dome.

p256: They've got to account for it.

p323: They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p240: He said he hoped for a first meeting within a few days.

p277: Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.

p308: Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p334: It means they actually control the programme.
p234: We have to have a full statement to Parliament.

p303: I've done it almost like a variety show.
p273: But the battle has only just begun.

p249: Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.

p336: This is in a league of its own.
p278: Our house was very small.

p360: There is much work to do.
p254: You will be.

p285: They tried to deny it.

p295: The mood was euphoric.
p250: What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?

p236: That time is not now, however.

p351: This is a defining moment in this parliament.
p301: He was married with a young child.
p259: Ferguson must take the blame.)

p361: You didn't get a modified.
p263: Mr Blair should be warned.

p347: There was no option.
NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p241
p340: You will never get a conviction.
p255: May not have been at fault?

p304: But he's not afraid to take risks.
p329: Drugs are always an issue.
p246: They make a selective perception process.

p341: We are seeing a Government in a hurry.
p226: We could not get any possession.

p316: I hope it comes out all right.
p244: I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.

p271: Then came the crunch.

p343: What was this?
p229: The oil companies would be asked to contribute.

p318: But Allen is deadly serious.
p228: I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.

p279: Until you hit the big games.

p276: We are talking about the outskirts of London.

p257: The oil companies would be asked to contribute.

p292: That, though, is an old story.
p293: It has been hijacked.
p227: The following are the principal provisions.

p335: You can expect a hell of a fuss.
p299: He is a man who lives to work.
p252: We are already seeing some positive results.

p238: I was very pleased with them today, though.

p272: Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.

p266: I saw the whole thing.

098
p288: I didn't play well last year.

p269: An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.

p313: Peter doesn't want to leave.
p300: There are a huge number of arts.
p314: I came up through the ranks.
NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p230
p287: We have got a race.

p268: Are you from the rugby ?

p294: I gave him a way out, and he took it.
p233: I cannot wait to get started on it.

p251: Two of the team became ill.

p317: Too much has already been said.
p310: I don't know how it happened.
p364: This is a one-off.
p333: There was no option.
p281: We live by the rule of law.

p330: Many other Scottish locations also feature.
p286: Last weekend was extremely frustrating.

p326: It was exactly four months away.
p363: It was good fun.
p231: We live by the rule of law.

NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p225
p283: Little is known about them.

p267: Sport is good for you.

p305: Are they control freaks?
p270: In the end we made too many errors.

p362: I thought he was my friend.
p264: how do you get it back?)

p284: It is a love affair.

p345: However, his involvement was instant.
p260: It is a love affair.

p248: Two of the team became ill.

p280: Over one million people have been forced from their homes.

p376: "We live by the rule of law."
p311: He's got me very well.
p339: This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p253: I wish I had put on a brighter tie.

p306: There are a huge number of arts.
p274: I did not concentrate on my performance.)

p302: That certainly brought me back down to earth.
p261: I had a ball today.

p275: There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.

p239: The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.

p374: They might also be reviewed by their colleagues.
p307: Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p247: He had missed a penalty against the English.)

p243: Over one million people have been forced from their homes.

p298: She is on a life support machine.
p312: He added, The old system has reached its limits.
p237: I wish I had put on a brighter tie.

p258: Before the game we went for a pint.

p262: However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.

p265: She reflects a bit.

p245: Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.

p297: My wife and family are the support system.
p232: I wish I had put on a brighter tie.

p282: I wish I had put on a brighter tie.

p256: She told The Herald.

p323: They are not suitable.
p240: It was a good performance.

p277: Today I couldn't run on it.

p308: That certainly brought me back down to earth.
p334: And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
p234: I cannot wait to get started on it.

p303: She is on a life support machine.
p273: The following are the principal provisions.

p249: Today I couldn't run on it.

p336: The partnership was set up during the summer.
p278: Why do it otherwise ?

p360: The release attracted little attention.
p254: Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.

p285: After that time, the market itself will set the prices.

p295: The time of judgment has arrived.
p250: So, did she meet him ?

p236: We created so many chances.

p351: They have played their part.
p301: Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p259: Figures are not relevant to the strategy.)

p361: What kind of person is he?
p263: You might not make it.

p347: What's it got to do with art?
p241: I love the Dome.

p340: He did not have to stop and think.
p255: I had a ball today.

p304: We shouldn't have a rush to judgment.
p329: Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p246: Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.

p341: It is a great honour and a privilege.
p226: If you could find it.

p316: I will just have to be patient.
p244: It took an option on the process.

p271: It is annoying.

p343: I am not a fan of books.
p229: She's got to say something.

p318: Peter doesn't want to leave.
p228: The oil companies would be asked to contribute.

p279: The peace process will be buried!

p276: It was exactly four months away.

p257: They are now divorced.

p292: The real issue is personal.
p293: And he's the first to see that, and say that.
p227: It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.

p335: Harrowing is easy, after all.
p299: The website is now being amended.
p252: We're at home, which is important.

p238: Maybe this battle has been.

p272: Today I couldn't run on it.

p266: Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.

099
p288: It was an adventure.

p269: However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.

p313: He wouldn't allow that to happen.
p300: They are, therefore, not in favour of dispersal of sex offenders.
p314: Why does she suddenly win everything now?
p230: It has been a nightmare of frustration.

p287: He will go on the bench.

p268: Had I heard ?

p294: So is that it, then?
p233: That is the fact of the matter.

p251: That would be unlawful.

p317: He asked me in a tolerance zone.
p310: Peter doesn't want to leave.
p364: He liked to talk.
p333: Life is about people, and how you feel about people.
p281: This is a national crisis.

p330: There's nothing for the kids.
p286: Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.

p326: The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.
p363: This is a great shame.
p231: Two of the team became ill.

NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p225
p283: However, it did not end that way.

p267: We need to handle it.

p305: I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p270: That time is not now, however.

p362: What kind of person is he?
p264: What are you not good at?)

p284: However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.

p345: It has to work.
p260: However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.

p248: That's all right then.

p280: Even if he doesn't have any lines.

p376: "Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill."
p311: It's like an extension of your body.
p339: What you sow, you have to reap.
p253: However, we have not come to any conclusions.

p306: They are, therefore, not in favour of dispersal of sex offenders.
p274: But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.)

p302: Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
p261: No, the equipment is extra.

p275: Oil embargo endorsed.

p239: We will pay their bills.

p374: He loved it, and so did they.
p307: Anyone remaining after that will be targeted.
p247: The oil companies would be asked to contribute.)

p243: Even if he doesn't have any lines.

p298: Their vision was not impeded.
p312: We could easily be cut again.
p237: By that time, however, it was already too late.

p258: Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.

p262: Two of the team became ill.

p265: Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.

p245: They had to be cut from the wreckage.

p297: The scheme is hopelessly failing.
p232: They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.

p282: However, we have not come to any conclusions.

p256: It was clear.

p323: It does seem a mystery.
p240: I see no need for change.

p277: This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.

p308: Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
p334: They chose to side with terror.
p234: That is the fact of the matter.

p303: Their vision was not impeded.
p273: Before the game we went for a pint.

p249: However, it did not end that way.

p336: That statement has never been withdrawn.
p278: What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?

p360: It was the dreaded sentence.
p254: And rugby fans can help.

p285: No, the equipment is extra.

p295: Mind you, it wouldn't be a bad idea.
p250: So what is the campaign about ?

p236: Before the game we went for a pint.

p351: They were unable to revive him.
p301: Anyone remaining after that will be targeted.
p259: He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.)

p361: Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
p263: Officers recovered a second body in the area.

p347: Could they perhaps be related?
p241: They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.

p340: We deserved to win it.
p255: Two of the team became ill.

p304: I live on the streets of Glasgow.
p329: This kind of problem arises everywhere.
p246: No, the equipment is extra.

p341: We certainly will need to watch him.
p226: He is hungry for success and I am the same.

p316: It's a sensible management decision.
p244: By then, he was walking on water.

p271: It is home-grown.

p343: It may well have been.
p229: He is hungry for success and I am the same.

p318: He wouldn't allow that to happen.
p228: It is annoying.

p279: The oil companies would be asked to contribute.

p276: This is equally relevant to the landowner.

p257: They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.

p292: Life becomes a song.
p293: They must put them back.
p227: While they went on holiday, we got the contract.

p335: That is nearly four people every day.
p299: It was a bit of a struggle today.
p252: They prepared some food very quickly.

p238: Then followed a bout of flu.

p272: This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.

p266: Journalists should make him.

100
p288: I did not think about the Ryder Cup.

p269: May not have been at fault?

p313: They've just got to believe in themselves.
p300: My office is bare.
p314: His team management was protective.
p230: But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.

p287: You had better believe it.

p268: What happened in that game ?

p294: You should have let it write the cards.
p233: It should be a condition of employment.

p251: No date has been set for the appeal.

p317: But don't worry just yet.
p310: After that nothing could save him.
p364: Lots of others were doing the same.
p333: Could they perhaps be related?
p281: Otherwise, the market may come back.

p330: Creative, expressive football was the order of the day.
p286: The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.

p326: It was set in a cafe.
p363: We talk about effective military action.
p231: No, the equipment is extra.

NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p225
p283: It really was an unusual award.

p267: They will notice a difference.

p305: They never looked like winning it either.
p270: The following are the principal provisions.

p362: There's a strong involvement.
p264: His massive advantage was never under threat yesterday.)

p284: May not have been at fault?

p345: It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
p260: May not have been at fault?

p248: That would be unlawful.

p280: I am delighted to hear this news.

p376: "We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors."
p311: It is quite a new prescription.
p339: He is a one-off.
p253: It is a love affair.

p306: My office is bare.
p274: Before the game we went for a pint.)

p302: We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p261: It is a good lifestyle.

p275: There were no grounds for his action.

p239: Sales are falling after years of growth.

p374: I want to be there by right.
p307: They serve a multitude of purposes.
p247: And they had a case.)

p243: I am delighted to hear this news.

p298: Sooner rather than later, though, the healing must begin.
p312: The plot is minimal.
p237: They were outside the circle.

p258: It's not perfect.

p262: Oil embargo endorsed.

p265: The cause of the fire is not yet known.

p245: I was angry.

p297: The body follows the mind.
p232: It was mayhem.

p282: It is a love affair.

p256: There was no rescue.

p323: But he is something special, is he not?
p240: We have every respect for Michelle.

p277: I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.

p308: We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p334: Justice was not seen today.
p234: It should be a condition of employment.

p303: Sooner rather than later, though, the healing must begin.
p273: Athletics is on a roll in the country.

p249: We must look forward.

p336: The supporters gave us a lot of passion.
p278: So, did she meet him ?

p360: I have never considered it.
p254: Now the system is right behind us.

p285: We have an election in eight days.

p295: You can take it almost anywhere and practise.
p250: And does it ?

p236: Our house was very small.

p351: He confirmed that the document was valid.
p301: They serve a multitude of purposes.
p259: It was clear on Thursday.)

p361: What has changed since then?
p263: However, a decision should be made before the end of August.

p347: But who shot the president?
p241: It was mayhem.

p340: Or did it?
p255: That time is not now, however.

p304: Did you get the script?
p329: There are lots of these women in Finland.
p246: That would be unlawful.

p341: I don't think it could be clearer.
p226: They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.

p316: I kept it very simple.
p244: This is a game of confidence.

p271: They are now divorced.

p343: Frankly, the party was not being honest with itself.
p229: They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.

p318: They have just got to believe in themselves.
p228: We could not get any possession.

p279: We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.

p276: THE Farmer wants a new campaign.

p257: It was mayhem.

p292: It's about time something was done about equipment.
p293: You do have a way out.
p227: I had a fortunate war.

p335: There are nine people here now.
p299: If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?
p252: The circumstances have changed since last year.

p238: Both sides have been hit by injury.

p272: I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.

p266: May not have been at fault?

101
p288: I'm not depressed.

p269: We want to get to the final, anyway.

p313: This is my personal assessment.
p300: Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p314: He was the deputy editor at the paper.
p230: Before the game we went for a pint.

p287: New Year will be very busy.

p268: Are you going to win ?

p294: It's annoying in a way.
p233: I had no intention of misleading anyone.

p251: It is a good lifestyle.

p317: This championship is different from the other majors.
p310: Construction is due to begin in February.
p364: It is still holding good today.
p333: Happily we found it in the library.
p281: The following are the principal provisions.

p330: Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
p286: It really was an unusual award.

p326: It certainly gives you hope.
p363: I can't get it.
p231: That time is not now, however.

NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p225
p283: IT has been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.

NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p267
p305: The party lasted all night.
p270: But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.

p362: This is complete nonsense.
p264: Two of our crew were killed.)

p284: They tried to deny it.

p345: Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
p260: They tried to deny it.

p248: That time is not now, however.

p280: We are already seeing some positive results.

p376: "Oil embargo endorsed."
p311: Johnsen is equally concerned.
p339: Six men will take the decision.
p253: Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.

p306: Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p274: Our house was very small.)

p302: Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
p261: Before the game we went for a pint.

p275: He takes the job.

p239: It was exactly four months away.

p374: That was very important.
p307: But his attendance is not guaranteed.
p247: It was clear on Thursday.)

p243: We are already seeing some positive results.

p298: The election is total confusion and chaos.
p312: The scheme is hopelessly failing.
p237: A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.

p258: They had to be cut from the wreckage.

p262: It is a good lifestyle.

p265: I was just appalled at the way they behaved.

p245: That team is due to be announced this morning.

p297: That gives it a spirit.
p232: They were outside the circle.

p282: Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.

p256: We could not get any possession.

p323: Club rugby refuses to die.
p240: But they did not even get a reply to their letter.

p277: It was clear.

p308: Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
p334: I would never even consider it.
p234: I had no intention of misleading anyone.

p303: The election is total confusion and chaos.
p273: I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.

p249: It is an old family habit.

p336: That is unlikely to happen.
p278: So what is the campaign about ?

p360: It is not in the public interest.
p254: However, it did not end that way.

p285: Oil embargo endorsed.

p295: We want to be separate from our neighbours.
p250: Are you from the rugby ?

p236: It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.

p351: In part that reflected the times.
p301: But his attendance is not guaranteed.
p259: I did not have a bet on myself.)

p361: He knows he is good.
p263: Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.

p347: We do not get that impression now.
p241: A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.

p340: It's just not funny!
p255: Oil embargo endorsed.

p304: This is an exciting time in Scottish politics.
p329: Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
p246: Oil embargo endorsed.

p341: That meant the search was unlawful.
p226: It was mayhem.

p316: The rest was badminton.
p244: On Saturday, it was much the same.

p271: I wish I had put on a brighter tie.

p343: We can only go up.
p229: She has so much to offer.

p318: This is my personal assessment.
p228: I love the Dome.

p279: The selection process is still at a very early stage.

p276: We are satisfied with this outcome.

p257: However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.

p292: I've learned from my mistakes.
p293: Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
p227: I did not see any reason to change the captain.

p335: I like what has happened!
p299: It's amazing it happened in the daytime.
p252: In his new cabinet role as party chairman, it will become his primary task.

p238: It will take a few years before we see the full benefit.

p272: It was clear.

p266: Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.

102
p288: He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.

p269: Oil embargo endorsed.

p313: There was no trouble at all.
p300: Where is the anthrax?
p314: The proposal was rejected.
p230: This was a good move for me.

p287: There's still plenty time left.

p268: You should try to have a laugh.

p294: It's too close to call.
p233: It is much as it has been described.

p251: That is no use.

p317: For now, though, my future is with Rangers.
p310: We shall rely on human beings.
p364: This takes the pressure off.
p333: We all thought we were going to die.
p281: Movement has to take place.

p330: The feeling is marvellous.
p286: I cannot believe this decision.

p326: If he does not leave, he will be shot.
p363: It was entirely justified.
p231: It's not a quick fix.

NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p225
p283: The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.

p267: Such actions are rarely popular.

p305: No details of the talks were given.
p270: The new system will be marketed this summer.

p362: This Government is cutting taxes.
p264: I feel confident about the outcome.)

p284: They make a selective perception process.

p345: There's something about being cut off.
p260: They make a selective perception process.

p248: Oil embargo endorsed.

p280: We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.

p376: "He takes the job."
p311: Which he is, too.
p339: To have Mr Clinton is quite an accolade.
p253: They make a selective perception process.

p306: Where is the anthrax?
p274: I did not think about the Ryder Cup.)

p302: Does it feel like the ideas and emotions?
p261: We are also looking for new licences.

p275: She reflects a bit.

p239: But they also noted a partial strengthening of survey evidence.

p374: Two and a half million people have died.
p307: I am sure all schools would accept that.
p247: But it is up again.)

p243: We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.

p298: Next league matches, Dundee United - Kilmarnock.
p312: They're just a nonsense.
p237: But it was a pleasure.

p258: She has been shot.

p262: It was an adventure.

p265: According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.

p245: I have had no social life at all.

p297: It isn't just a defining issue for them.
p232: It was a good performance.

p282: They make a selective perception process.

p256: They are now divorced.

p323: That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
p240: He takes the job.

p277: It is annoying.

p308: Does it feel like the ideas and emotions?
p334: Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
p234: It is much as it has been described.

p303: Next league matches, Dundee United - Kilmarnock.
p273: While they went on holiday, we got the contract.

p249: That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.

p336: That is a mark of what you are.
p278: And does it ?

p360: They had been forced to walk.
p254: This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.

p285: For these people, the ruling is very welcome.

p295: Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
p250: Had I heard ?

p236: It became difficult for me.

p351: That is not true.
p301: I am sure all schools would accept that.
p259: The selection process is still at a very early stage.)

p361: I welcome the decision.
p263: I did not have a bet on myself.

p347: I'm looking forward to that.

p340: His own excitement is never difficult to detect.
p255: Scotland were beaten again.

p304: There, you were just a body.
p329: There is no guarantee.
p246: But they did not even get a reply to their letter.

p341: He put some colour into Scottish history.
p226: I am not willing to say anything about any couple.

p316: It will take several days.
p244: He liked the weather, the courses, the food.

p271: I saw the whole thing.

p343: I am not a doctor.

p318: There was no trouble at all.

p335: This would not be my first choice.
p299: This is thought to mean sometime next week.
p252: They had three children.

p238: It's very dangerous for markets.

p272: It is annoying.

p266: Here, again, they were denied a voice.

103

p269: But they did not even get a reply to their letter.

p313: Although, you never know.
p300: Housing is in very short supply.
p314: First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p230: It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.

p287: That was the first step.

p268: There can be no compromise on welfare.

p294: It's a long process.
p233: Police said the family was helping with the search.

p251: They had to be cut from the wreckage.

p317: I drove the ball well.
p310: In fact, that would be a distortion of the truth.
p364: Our legal advice is clear.
p333: Maybe he will act again.
p281: City sentiment is in his favour.

p330: An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
p286: The allegations were still under investigation, he added.

p326: Brown is an interesting man, but he's not desperate.
p363: He demanded to speak to the boss.
p231: Why do it otherwise ?

p225: Everyone deserves to share in this success.

p283: We could not get any possession.

p267: He has done that with a great deal to spare.

p305: It is understood they saw one body.
p270: We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.

p362: The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
p264: The referee had been right.)

p284: Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.

p345: This is his personal life.

p248: I didn't play well last year.

p280: We were under a bit of pressure.

p339: We should not be surprised at that.
p253: Two of the team became ill.

p306: Housing is in very short supply.
p274: I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.)

p302: He is only now regaining his confidence.
p261: Our house was very small.

p275: Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped him form.

p239: We have a major concern about enforcement action.

p374: I hope they understand that.
p307: I am very sorry to be here.
p247: She has so much to offer.)

p243: We were under a bit of pressure.

p298: He went to see what he could learn.
p312: There may be some resistance.
p237: It was some time before she found out he was safe.

p258: He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.

p262: It's not perfect.

p265: He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.

p245: Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.

p297: However, what is his calibre?
p232: We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.

p282: Two of the team became ill.

p256: The court heard he drove into the path of a car.

p323: He could look after himself, but didn't.
p240: They will want to perform well.

p277: But I was wrong.

p308: He is only now regaining his confidence.
p334: We should just say no.
p234: Police said the family was helping with the search.

p303: He went to see what he could learn.
p273: We deserve a significant rise.

p249: Until you hit the big games.

p336: This is not finished.
p278: Are you from the rugby ?

p360: It is harder than you think.
p254: The group is due to report by the end of the year.

p285: She reflects a bit.

p295: Have you heard anything from Paramount?
p250: It is an old family habit.

p236: It's not a lack of effort.

p351: Yes, it was too short a night.
p301: I am very sorry to be here.
p259: It's good to have a voice.)

p361: It could take some time.
p263: I saw the whole thing.

p347: It was not a beautiful game, was it?
p241: We want to get to the final, anyway.

p340: He almost admitted as much.
p255: Before the game we went for a pint.

p304: He will suspend it on Thursday afternoon.
p329: We make good weapons.
p246: Before the game we went for a pint.

p341: People buy everything with cash.
p226: They were outside the circle.

p316: We had to push to get a goal.
p244: The door is still open, but we need a bit of help.

p271: However, we have not come to any conclusions.

p343: It is all in the mind.
p229: It is a good day for the coalition.

p318: Although, you never know.
p228: I wish I had put on a brighter tie.

p279: After that time, the market itself will set the prices.

p276: It wasn't possible to relax.

p257: We have every respect for Michelle.

p292: I have got a knife.

p313: We shall be victorious.
p300: After all, he is the King of Scotland.
p314: We wanted it left for a wee while.
p230: I was just appalled at the way they behaved.

p287: I was impressed with them.

p268: He will be kept informed.

p294: I asked to take it up to Glasgow.
p233: She was there for the start of the campaign.

p251: Further protests are likely.

p317: If so, how does it intend to achieve this result?
p310: He wouldn't allow that to happen.
p364: But he has a lifeline.
p333: Safety was also an issue.
p281: It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.

p330: It was more like a Labour Party rally.
p286: Until you hit the big games.

p326: We've all been there at some point.
p363: It's somewhere in between.
p231: What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?

p225: His is a success story by any standard.

p283: That is the important thing.

p267: Then again, we could have.

p305: It was a wilful act of violence.
p270: I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.

p362: They know their son was murdered.
p264: Jack was always going to win this one.)

p284: That's all right then.

p345: I asked for a picture and she said, No problem.
p260: That's all right then.

p248: That is no use.

p280: They won't actually make any money from it.

p376: "It's not a new concept in jazz."
p311: But things are never the same again.
p339: It was a disaster.
p253: That would be unlawful.

p306: After all, he is the King of Scotland.
p274: While they went on holiday, we got the contract.)

p302: Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
p261: It was a funny game.

p275: Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.

p239: I am so proud of him.

p374: Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p307: I needed a change, a new challenge.
p247: Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.)

p243: They won't actually make any money from it.

p298: It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.

p237: We want to get to the final, anyway.

p258: According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.

p262: While they went on holiday, we got the contract.

p265: It's a shame.

p245: I'm delighted about that.

p297: If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
p232: There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.

p282: That would be unlawful.

p256: Journalists should make him.

p323: The decision was designed to shock investors.
p240: That all hope is never lost.

p277: I love the Dome.

p308: Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
p334: We are not out of touch with politics.
p234: She was there for the start of the campaign.

p303: It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.
p273: Got to win today, though.

p249: Then came the crunch.

p278: Had I heard ?

p360: The call was ignored.
p254: I love the Dome.

p285: It was an interesting thing to do.

p295: Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p250: The allegations were still under investigation, he added.

p259: They will remember this victory for a while.)

p361: The girls are so lucky to be alive.

p304: Four people died instantly.
p329: I'm confident we can turn things around.
p246: It was an adventure.

p341: We are trying to establish a date.
p226: However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.

p316: That got me out.
p244: The trick is to try it.

p271: I'm not looking for a breakthrough.

p343: And we have beaten them before.
p229: We work on the same level.

p318: We shall be victorious.
p228: He is hungry for success and I am the same.

p279: I see no need for change.

p276: Context is also very important.

p257: That time is not now, however.

p292: It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
p293: And, also, when he does not have the ball.
p227: And the match was not too bad, either.

p335: Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p299: The breakdown was much later in her life.

p313: The quality of work is very impressive.
p300: People just came on their own.
p314: That would be even more disastrous.
p230: It is close to call.

p287: Such actions are rarely popular.

p268: Maybe this battle has been.

p294: Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
p233: He has become a monster.

p251: I was fighting for my life, I thought.

p317: His handling raises a wider issue.
p310: His treatment has been quite atrocious.
p364: This is a horrible loss.
p333: That's why he visited.
p281: It's not a lack of confidence.

p330: The conductor, too, will have adjustments to make.
p286: The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.

p326: I'm totally horrified by the sentence.
p363: The play was to go straight ahead.

p305: T, Is there anything in the wound?

p248: That all hope is never lost.

p280: I bought a flat six years ago.

p339: We have been so lucky.
NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p253
p306: People just came on their own.
p274: According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.)

p361: It may be tomorrow - but it may be later.
p263: The investment will be in the food.

p347: That's why he visited.

p255: According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.

p304: He did not know his daughter.
p329: He lost his job, but it was not just a job.

p362: So is that it, then?
p264: You're quite wrong, he said.)

p307: And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
p247: Athletics is on a roll in the country.)

p243: What are they for ?

p298: Tell you the team he picked?
p312: I believe he could have turned it around.
p237: Who would be right ?

p258: Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.

p262: Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.

p265: That's all right then.

p245: Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.

p297: We are just being flooded.
p232: You had better believe it.

p282: Is that right?

p256: They will want to perform well.

p323: It doesn't make them evil.
p240: In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.

p277: Two of the team became ill.

p308: She will also get a pay rise.
p334: It didn't take long.
p234: That would be a serious problem.

p303: Tell you the team he picked?
p273: Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.

p249: It is a good lifestyle.

p336: That is how we will be judged.
p278: They almost achieved a draw.

p360: She was close to suicide at one stage.
p254: That all hope is never lost.

p285: It is so sad.

p295: It is reform in return for resources.
NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p250
p236: I've heard this stuff about the markets.

p351: It's all about money, money, money.
p301: And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
p259: Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.)

p361: Next league matches, Aberdeen - Dundee United.
p263: That all hope is never lost.

p347: It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p241: The breakdown was much later in her life.

p340: Are there any he wants to play?
p255: Maybe this battle has been.

p304: We are about to have our own Parliament.
p329: They could not hear.
p246: They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.

p341: I love this tournament.
p226: The eye was badly closed on Sunday.

p316: It has until Saturday.
p244: But he has not become a monster.

p257: I don't have many friends.

p292: They were back in favour with the SAC.
p293: There is no musical background in his family.
p227: It has removed a bit of guilt.

p335: I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p299: Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p252: There was no reason.

p238: Harrowing is easy, after all.

p272: Two of the team became ill.

p266: According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.

113
p288: It is rubbish.

p269: We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.

p313: We played so well at times.
p300: Look at them after three days of rain.
p314: This would not be my first choice.
p230: You can spend money on housing.

p287: There were no grounds for his action.

p268: England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.

p294: I don't know the nature of the illness.
p233: The picture is the same across Scotland.

p251: We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.

p317: The company has other problems with the shells.
p310: But there is another side.
p364: It was just great.
p333: I'm surprised to hear it from Tony.
p281: Or it would have been.

p330: Don't say you have not been warned.
p286: But I know the course.

p326: The site has been fully recorded and surveyed.
p363: That was certainly the case for the parties.
p231: It proved a good decision.

p225: The big issue for us is the review.

p283: There is a contract in existence for Allan.

p267: What do we do ?

p305: Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
p270: IT HAS been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.

p362: I've never felt affection for Emu.
p264: Firm action must be taken.)

p284: It was the eighties.

p345: I have been thinking about that this week.
p260: It was the eighties.

p248: Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.

p280: Is there a waiting list ?

p376: "There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end."
p311: Don't get me wrong.
p339: Sometimes they come off.
p253: He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.

p306: Look at them after three days of rain.
p274: Structural changes were also required.)

NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p302
p261: He thought she was amazing.

p275: Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.

p239: We have thought about doing lots of things.

p374: We are at an advanced stage, and are now instructing counsel.
p307: The conversion didn't go over either.
p247: Our offer represents an attractive price for the business.)

p243: Is there a waiting list ?

p298: Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.
p312: Secondly, there are other options for patients.
p237: It's a shame.

p258: I joined a group.

p262: Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.

p265: I'm so angry.

p245: Next season for every manager is a long time away.

p297: This ruling is unfair to everyone.
p232: It's not fair.

p282: He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.

p256: It's not perfect.

p323: I have played really well all year.
p240: This film will be totally awesome.

p277: He takes the job.

p308: They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.
p334: This meeting is the path to salvation.
p234: Our action is not the end, but the beginning of a process.

p303: Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.
p273: Here, again, they were denied a voice.

p249: It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.

p336: It's there for people to look at.
p278: Football is a passion for many.

p360: They took a risk.
p254: And I thought - we have to do something with this.

p285: Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.

p295: It offers a different viewpoint.
p250: Mr Wilson has received no such request.

p236: You can spend money on housing.

p351: What's the problem?
p301: The conversion didn't go over either.
p259: He was jailed for a year.)

p361: He is a pro.
p263: It should be a great game, though.

p347: They are all Arabs.
p241: It's not fair.

p340: The film is on a tightrope.
p255: I'm delighted about that.

p304: Part of the complex is historic.
p329: It has been hijacked.
p246: Who would be a referee?

p341: This is thought to mean sometime next week.
p226: The Prime Minister was very saddened to hear about this.

p316: I've tried to get on with my life.
p244: He is not a dancer.

p271: According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.

p343: The odds are that it will.
p229: I don't have many friends.

p318: We played so well at times.
p228: For these people, the ruling is very welcome.

p279: I was angry.

p276: Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.

p257: It's a shame.

p292: The squad is too small.
p293: The cost of war is more than that.
p227: However, we have to be cautious.

p335: Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.
p299: He had other things on his mind.
p252: It gets too much.

p238: Those people must be accountable.

p272: He takes the job.

p266: Is that right?

114
p288: This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.

p269: It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.

p313: I was very fortunate.
p300: I didn't realise it had reached that stage.
p314: His wife Margaret was not in court.
p230: That admission is not surprising.

p287: We have a training class.

p268: Well, he is an artist.

p294: The industry will try to get round it.
p233: It was the eighties.

p251: It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.

p364: You are always aware of the injury potential.
p333: The days of empty promises are over.
p281: His is a success story by any standard.

p330: Some were close to tears.
p286: Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.

p326: Thousands of others have not been so fortunate.
p363: I hope the couples are still together.
p231: Maybe this battle has been.

p225: I told him I was a long time ago.

p283: Their attitude is all wrong.

p267: Why do it otherwise ?

p305: We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p270: The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.

p362: He had returned to die.
p264: But they had to be paid for.)

p284: I did not see any reason to change the captain.

p345: Let's get it on.
p260: I did not see any reason to change the captain.

p248: It's not a new concept in jazz.

p280: Do they think anyone else wants them ?

p376: "It is a delight on every level."
p311: It is nearly there.
p339: We're not that bad.
p253: It's a shame.

NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p306
p274: It was a good game to watch.)

p302: It is time for a more honest approach.
p261: Maybe this battle has been.

p275: The mood is upbeat.

p239: It is sometimes like that.

p374: I don't think it would make any difference.
p307: He took away my childhood.
p247: The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.)

p243: Do they think anyone else wants them ?

p298: The cold war is over.
p312: Where do you think she is going?
p237: I came to complete.

p258: This is the end of a chapter, and it is very sad.

p262: They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.

p265: Holland won by five wickets.

p245: They keep the atmosphere in mind.

p297: It is, honestly, difficult to write about this.
p232: We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.

p282: It's a shame.

p256: It was the eighties.

p323: We were a shambles at the back.
p240: Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.

p277: She reflects a bit.

p308: It is time for a more honest approach.
p334: Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
p234: People have been placed in a state of alarm.

p303: The cold war is over.
p273: We would make a start.

p249: According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.

p336: We are getting there.
p278: I didn't think so either.

p360: Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p254: It was really enjoyable on Saturday.

p285: In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.

p295: The band was good, and it's been a great day.
p250: Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.

p236: The hearing was due to continue today.

p351: Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.
p301: He took away my childhood.
p259: The whole thing is the music.)

p361: They have to tell it as it is.
p263: Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.

p347: The days of empty promises are over.
p241: We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.

p340: It was a question of patience.
p255: Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.

p304: We need to chat.
p329: His three-year appointment begins on Monday.
p246: That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.

p341: He had a heart problem.
p226: It was really enjoyable on Saturday.

p316: She has the biggest part.
p244: We had planned to sell the property for some time.

p271: I am an actor.

p343: After this, they were always in the driving seat.
p229: He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.

p318: I was very fortunate.
p228: They will want to perform well.

p279: This is a step backwards.

p276: It is sometimes like that.

p257: It was the eighties.

p292: Together they will attempt to express the whole.
p293: You, the British people, are the boss.
p227: But we could only help a handful of people.

p335: The dealer is on notice.
p299: I hadn't seen them in eight years.
p252: So they should be.

p238: If they liked it then I'll be happy.

p272: She reflects a bit.

p266: It is a total and utter change of culture.

115
p288: An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.

p269: Maybe this battle has been.

p313: Such a policy would be a disaster.
p300: There is no point in pushing it.
p314: Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p230: I can't even get into the A team.

p287: Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.

p268: Everything else is a bonus.

p294: Who will deliver more service to Scotland?
p233: We do not expect any surplus.

p251: Maybe this battle has been.

p317: He had done his homework properly.
p310: There is no guarantee.
p364: We don't know what is happening to them.
p333: I thought he was terrific.
p281: Its replacement was not used in the exercise.

p330: Seven children had lost both parents.
p286: We should recognise that others have done a good job.

p326: Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p363: We have learned a tremendous amount.
p231: January is a bad time of year.

p225: Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.

p283: We made a world record together.

p267: What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?

p305: Each day is a new beginning.
p270: Its replacement was not used in the exercise.

p362: Anyone can take a photo.
p264: That's the bit that's wrong.)

p284: It is so sad.

p345: Together they will attempt to express the whole.
p260: It is so sad.

p248: This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.

p280: So what happens next ?

p376: "Here, again, they were denied a voice."
p311: Otherwise we will pay the price.
p339: Today is a victory for the Scottish Parliament.
p253: It was the eighties.

p306: There is no point in pushing it.
p274: However, the problem is the timing.)

p302: The move is considered a major breakthrough.
p261: It isn't a happy memory.

p275: In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.

p239: The partners are looking for answers.

p374: They have just got to believe in themselves.
p307: They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
p247: Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.)

p243: So what happens next ?

p298: I'd like to take the plunge.
p312: This looks like it's anything but open.
NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p237
p258: Who would have?

p262: That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.

p265: The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.

p245: Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.

p297: That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p232: Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.

p282: It was the eighties.

p256: They were behind the wheel.

p323: Parts of the system are already overstretched.
p240: I'm delighted about that.

p277: I am just trying to do my job.

p308: The move is considered a major breakthrough.
p334: I was very pleased with them today, though.
p234: She is not a victim.

p303: I'd like to take the plunge.
p273: His job was not advertised.

p249: You had better believe it.

p336: I just couldn't believe what had happened.
p278: It was located on the remote control.

p360: It has no place in football.
p254: It is normal.

p285: It is rubbish.

p295: I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p250: It's good to have a voice.

p236: I can't even get into the A team.

p351: The way forward isn't going to be easy.
p301: They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
p259: New Year will be very busy.)

p361: This could easily have been another tragedy.
p263: It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.

p347: Henry was strong and talented.
p241: He will emerge as a world leader.

p340: I have never been in anything like that.
p255: I joined a group.

p304: Justice was not seen today.
p329: He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p246: There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.

p341: The breakdown was much later in her life.
p226: I did not think about the Ryder Cup.

p316: We will win this tie.
p244: A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.

p271: He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.

p343: I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p229: I came to complete.

p318: Such a policy would be a disaster.
p228: The eye was badly closed on Sunday.

p279: We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.

p276: He was unprepared for this fight.

p257: We do not expect any surplus.

p292: I'm just going to do my best.
p293: The door is open.
NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p227
p335: But it will backfire.
p299: Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
p252: No progress has been made.

p238: It's very bad timing, but it's happened.

p272: I am just trying to do my job.

p266: He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.

116
p288: That's all right then.

p269: My office is bare.

p313: We act because we must.
p300: He was the deputy editor at the paper.
p314: Which perhaps is just as well.
p230: Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.

p287: We did what we had to do.

p268: Harrowing is easy, after all.

p294: I want to make a vigorous defence.
p233: You had better believe it.

p251: I joined a group.

p317: Then, as we know too well, anything can happen.
p310: I'm confident we can turn things around.
p364: It's an old story.
p333: Henry was strong and talented.
p281: Such actions are rarely popular.

p330: So, how will it be received in the US?
p286: In the end we made too many errors.

p326: What she will do next?
p363: But that is not enough.
p231: I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.

p225: Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.

p283: A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.

p267: The abuse of elderly people was appalling.

p305: My daughter is an adult.
p270: The problem was a social problem.

p362: He is involved in everything.
p264: Nothing would now surprise me.)

p284: We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.

p345: Everyone is deeply shocked by this appaling accident.
p260: We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.

p248: Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.

p280: Had this been common practice ?

p376: "She has been shot."
p311: I find it rather oppressive.
p339: I feel strongly about it.
p253: It is so sad.

p306: He was the deputy editor at the paper.
p274: Which can happen any time.)

p302: I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
p261: Actors like to be in the centre.

p275: It's not fair.

p239: I've had it for the exams.

p374: If that is not a warning, what is it?
p307: The motive for the shooting was not known.
p247: We deserve a significant rise.)

p243: Had this been common practice ?

p298: Lately, that market has come under pressure.
p312: I am not against a further inquiry.
NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p237
p258: It is a delight on every level.

p262: Who would have?

p265: Twaddle is a case in point.

p245: I do not think this family will ever get over this.

p297: Obviously, Airbus is one of these.
p232: Maybe this battle has been.

p282: It is so sad.

p256: This is a step backwards.

p323: No passengers were on board.
p240: Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.

p277: Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.

p308: I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
p334: If you're going to do it, do it right.
p234: A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.

p303: Lately, that market has come under pressure.
p273: This is a frightening development.

p249: Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.

p336: They never got into the show this time.
p278: Maybe this battle has been.

p360: It is frustrating that we cannot do that.
p254: I was fighting for my life, I thought.

p285: Who would be a referee?

p295: I have no plans to retire.
p250: He was prepared for this.

p236: In addition, investor choice is reduced.

p351: It's the way we go about it.
p301: The motive for the shooting was not known.
p259: The result is a vacuum.)

p361: You should enjoy the day.
p263: He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.

p347: That is our unfinished business.
p241: I'm delighted about that.

p340: I have done ever since it was published.
p255: Does this mean.

p304: Among them are many criminals.
p329: She had been sexually assaulted.
p246: Who would have?

p341: I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p226: It is normal.

p316: This is totally untrue.
p244: In the end we have to take a stand.

p271: It was the eighties.

p343: But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
p229: I was angry.

p318: We act because we must.
p228: However, they will only be found in the wild.

p279: This film will be totally awesome.

p276: I've had it for the exams.

p257: Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.

p292: At the moment, the success in Germany is good.
p293: PR for Westminster is their holy grail.
p227: It is just a tax on employment.

p335: We kept going right to the final whistle.
p299: The next few months will tell.
p252: They need the money.

p238: Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.

p272: Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.

p266: It's a shame.

117
p288: There were no grounds for his action.

p269: Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.

p313: They will be destroyed.
p300: Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p314: It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p230: Which can happen any time.

p287: They made such decisions in London.

p268: Those people must be accountable.

p294: And she got it.
p233: Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.

p251: Does this mean.

p317: We must get the three points.
p310: We want to get to the final, anyway.
p364: It was an important part of the course.
p333: That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p281: I've heard this stuff about the markets.

p330: The government was consulting interested parties, he added.
p286: But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.

p326: Hopefully, everything is for the best.
p363: These people are helpless.
p231: It is much as it has been described.

p225: We have no influence on the Government's policy on the euro.

p283: It's for that reason he should resign.

p267: Something will be done by corporate bodies.

p305: Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
p270: Figures are not relevant to the strategy.

p362: No person was charged.
p264: Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.)

p284: It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.

p345: It is really good news.
p260: It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.

p248: Maybe this battle has been.

p280: What do they want us to do ?

p376: "It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged."

p239: Those people must be accountable.

p374: I fell in love with it.
p307: Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
p247: You had better believe it.)

p243: What do they want us to do ?

p298: And it's more subversive.
p312: Such is the scene of the tragedy.
p237: This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.

p258: You can spend money on housing.

p262: The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.

p277: While they went on holiday, we got the contract.

p308: I want to play at the highest level.
p334: He told the conference.
p234: And we had a good response.

p303: And it's more subversive.
p273: Which can happen any time.

p249: It's a long process.

p336: He, too, is keen to redress the balance.
p278: That might help a bit.

p360: This is a classic.
p254: We need to handle it.

p285: We enjoyed it today.

p295: The Scots are, however, in good company.
p250: However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.

p236: But his attendance is not guaranteed.

p351: I will be ridiculed.
p301: Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
p259: This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.)

p241: I joined a group.

p340: We have got to the top.
p255: They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.

p304: This is not about revenge.
p329: The event has now gone to Helsinki.
p246: Here, again, they were denied a voice.

p341: Both managements are very supportive.
p226: I don't have many friends.

p316: Or someone wants to say something different.
p244: This is a sea change in approach.

p271: I did not see any reason to change the captain.

p343: He also has property interests in the country.
p229: They were behind the wheel.

p318: They will be destroyed.
p228: It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.

p279: My office is bare.

p276: Those people must be accountable.

p257: It's not a new concept in jazz.

p292: They offered to make an investment into it.
p293: She doesn't know me, know anything about me.
p227: This should begin in October.

p335: Police were also perplexed.
p299: It felt like my support system was leaving.
p252: That is the only way to rate players.

p238: Many others are subjected to violence by men.

p272: While they went on holiday, we got the contract.

p266: It was the eighties.

118
p288: It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.

p269: This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.

p313: We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
p300: Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.
p314: He would just say it was terrible.
p230: It is too pretty, it is too small.

p287: She was also very brave.

p268: If they liked it then I'll be happy.

p294: We are the weakest link.
p233: It's not a new concept in jazz.

p251: It is rubbish.

p317: Players were held in equally low regard.
p310: It may be argued.
p364: It has been a great success.
p333: I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p281: It is much as it has been described.

p330: Above all, he was knocked out by the choir.
p286: We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.

p326: Two things will count for us in Brussels.
p363: I wish him well.
p231: Then again, we could have.

p225: We suffered a lot for seven years.

p283: There were no grounds for his action.

p267: We did what we had to do.

p305: We've come from a long way back.
p270: You were made to feel so welcome.

p362: You see, my back has gone.
p264: But I am in practice.)

p284: Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.

p345: We just want a fair deal.
p260: Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.

p248: But the fans deserve to know!

p280: The idea is the shop within a shop.

p376: "Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton."
p311: It is already making a difference.
p339: We have to put this behind us.
p253: The mood is upbeat.

p306: Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.
p274: This should begin in October.)

p302: Stalkers are capable of killing.
p261: But it took a lot of bottle.

p239: We feel very comfortable in this international environment.

p374: It ignores the future.
p307: Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.
p247: The website has changed the company.)

p243: The idea is the shop within a shop.

p298: We are losing this war.
p312: It's a double whammy.
p237: On this showing, they should stick with the lads.

p258: Here, again, they were denied a voice.

p262: I felt very strongly that England should have it.

p265: It plans to return to this field.

p245: He has been under great pressure.

p297: It's too big a risk to take.
p232: Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.

p282: The mood is upbeat.

p256: It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.

p323: If it does it means he has failed.
p240: This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.

p277: I was fighting for my life, I thought.

p308: Stalkers are capable of killing.
p334: The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p234: When we looked at the company.

p303: We are losing this war.
p273: That is far too high.

p249: They were behind the wheel.

p336: But no, it's not funny.
p278: This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.

p360: He played it like a veteran.
p254: Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.

p285: She does not want to speak.

p295: Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p250: The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.

p236: Three hours later, the man was free.

p351: There's nothing new in that argument.

p259: That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.)

p361: We couldn't get enough of it.
p263: It was won on the issue of the land.

p347: Faces from the Eighties.
p241: There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.

p340: In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p255: That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.

p304: How can we ignore it?
p329: That is different from being impartial.
p246: There were no grounds for his action.

p341: Whoever said that cannot have seen it.
p226: We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.

p316: I think they have to change that.
p244: Otherwise, the market may come back.

p271: It is so sad.

p343: That is the position the MoD has adopted.
p229: The fire was above the hole.

p318: We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
p228: Further protests are likely.

p279: Does this mean.

p276: If they liked it then I'll be happy.

p257: We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.

p292: We have no knowledge of this.
p293: These are long-term investments.
p227: My life has changed a lot.

p335: For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
p299: It is crucial for both teams.
p252: Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.

p238: It's going to be epic.

p272: I was fighting for my life, I thought.

p266: I did not see any reason to change the captain.

119
p288: It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.

p269: It was a delight on every level.

p313: O Neill is reputed to have replied.
p300: Completion is expected by October the following year.
p314: They have got their position, we have got our position.
p230: But this time we can have no excuses.

p287: But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.

p268: They would be supported by visiting specialists.

p294: We have now no choice.
p233: My office is bare.

p251: This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.

p317: I was in the train station overnight.
p310: He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p364: I will be trying to do better tomorrow.
p333: We must improve our relations with government.
p281: They've got to account for it.

p330: There will always be someone, somewhere, willing to undercut on price.
p286: Our offer represents an attractive price for the business.

p326: She has now been registered as disabled.
p363: Only the details have to be sorted out.
p231: It is a delight on every level.

NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p225
p283: It's been a long wait.

p267: I am the Son of Sam.

p305: A lot of things can go wrong.
p270: You must always attempt to raise the bar.

p362: He's a nice guy.
p264: Trading is tough at the moment.)

p284: It is rubbish.

p345: I'll just have to live with that.
p260: It is rubbish.

p248: Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.

p280: I left five minutes after he had finished his round.

p376: "I was furious."
p311: He decides to do something about it.
p339: I thought it was quite good.
p253: It is rubbish.

p306: Completion is expected by October the following year.
p274: I was on a roll.)

p302: It ignores the future.
p261: Structural changes were also required.

p275: Who would be a referee?

p239: The Festival is prepared to help.

p374: The quality of work is very impressive.
p307: It is not great art.
p247: This is a step backwards.)

p243: I left five minutes after he had finished his round.

p298: Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
p312: What's the theme?
p237: Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.

p258: Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.

p262: Next season for every manager is a long time away.

p265: They took a risk.

p245: Who will attend?

p297: It's an expensive part of their equipment.
p232: This is the end of a chapter, and this is very sad.

p282: It is rubbish.

p256: I joined a group.

p323: She added, It is the same story in both countries.
p240: She really suffered for her art.

p277: Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.

p308: It ignores the future.
p334: We tend to come good at the end.
p234: No, the equipment is extra.

p303: Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
p273: My life has changed a lot.

p249: It was ugly.

p336: We just try to make great records.
p278: Ferguson will be a millionaire.

p360: I have spoken to head office.
p254: It's a long process.

p285: Here, again, they were denied a voice.

p295: There were far more pressing matters to consider.
p250: No, the equipment is extra.

p236: Which can happen any time.

p351: This time it was out of the blue.
p301: It is not great art.
p259: We have the mental strength.)

p361: Cost is a factor, but not the only one.
p263: Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.

p347: Why did it take a concerted campaign?
p241: Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.

p340: And it worked, so we kept it.
p255: Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.

p304: It's totally double standards.
p329: Both offices were closed yesterday.
p246: It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.

p341: He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p226: Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.

p316: This series is for real.
p244: The procedures were not in place.

p271: You had better believe it.

p343: The hearing was expected to last six weeks.
p229: It's not fair.

p318: O Neill is reputed to have replied.
p228: It's in his blood.

p279: They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.

p276: It's very bad timing, but it's happened.

p257: I'm delighted about that.

p292: I was influenced by all of these things.
p293: Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p227: We did what we had to do.

p335: Britain may now be forced to listen.
p299: I am happy with my form.
p252: Its failure is no surprise.

p238: What form did that take ?

p272: Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.

p266: In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.

120
p288: I'm so angry.

NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p269
p313: The Tory party will last.
p300: However, it very nearly all went wrong.
p314: That's not fair to the supporters.
p230: They are very happy with the new settlement.

p287: You are a gambling man.

p268: The ethos of the school was outstanding.

p294: My father and mother are.
p233: I'm delighted about that.

p251: We work on the same level.

p317: It's to do with context.
p310: I bought a car at auction.
p364: Who will take them after that?
p333: Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
p281: Then again, we could have.

p330: Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?
p286: The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.

p326: Today's meeting was open and friendly.
p363: It would be really interesting if they did.
p231: There were no grounds for his action.

p225: The industry is not well organised.

p283: There is no credible official announcement.

p267: You've got to be vigilant.

p305: He seemed to lose his focus.
p270: You can spend money on housing.

p362: The fire was still coming down.
p264: It came a bit late.)

p284: That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.

p345: Neither of them was badly hurt.
p260: That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.

p248: They've got to account for it.

p280: It is the right package for Scotland.

p376: "She really suffered for her art."
p311: There were no new cases yesterday.
p339: This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
p253: Who would be a referee?

p306: However, it very nearly all went wrong.
p274: There is no evidence that these people are helpful.)

p302: Britain may now be forced to listen.
p261: I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.

p275: That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.

p239: Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.

p374: That's not going to happen again.
p307: You do not change overnight.
p247: There's still plenty time left.)

p243: It is the right package for Scotland.

p298: After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.
p312: We are satisfied that this is the case.
p237: Does this mean.

p258: There will be no shortage of quality applicants.

p262: They keep the atmosphere in mind.

p265: We work well together.

p245: However, the players should have a voice in these matters.

p297: Our lives have been turned upside down.
p232: It is rubbish.

p282: Who would be a referee?

p256: It is rubbish.

p323: We have a high quality product.
p240: It is a delight on every level.

p277: It is so sad.

p308: Britain may now be forced to listen.
p334: He also received a medal of honour.
p234: For these people, the ruling is very welcome.

p303: After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.
p273: Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.

p249: Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.

p336: It's almost certainly not going to help.
p278: You can spend money on housing.

p360: I'm not thinking about anyone else.
p254: They were behind the wheel.

p285: There were no grounds for his action.

p295: The whole thing in general is moving on.
p250: It didn't come as any great surprise.

p236: The colours are very pretty.

p351: We need to get the right people in.
p301: You do not change overnight.
p259: Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.)

p361: I am not very pleased.
p263: The fire was above the hole.

p347: Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
p241: An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.

p340: The king is delighted by the honour.
p255: An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.

p304: Strikers like to go to the ground.
p329: They don't have to, but they normally do.
p246: She really suffered for her art.

p341: The choice is strictly personal.
p226: It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.

p316: It's great news, isn't it.
p244: For these people, the ruling is very welcome.

p271: It's not fair.

p343: I cannot believe this decision.
p229: We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.

p318: The Tory party will last.
p228: I don't want to use the term.

p279: That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.

p276: Choice is a good thing.

p257: Does this mean.

p292: Is my wife a racist?
p293: He also wants to play in this game, and that's important.
p227: Why do it otherwise ?

p335: JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
p299: You can see their point.
p252: No country has a similar training programme.

p238: Are they free ?

p272: It is so sad.

p266: Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.

121
p288: It has removed a bit of guilt.

p269: We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.

p313: It was a journey into a new life.
p300: It is not a definite proposal as yet.
p314: I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p230: The abuse of elderly people was appalling.

p287: My conscience is not clear.

p268: Or so the story goes.

p294: We don't know what happened after.
p233: I joined a group.

p251: We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.

p317: Now we need to keep our heads up.
p310: And who were they anyway, beforehand?
p364: It is part of their job.
p333: This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p281: We have a training class.

p330: Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p286: It is an impressive record.

p326: Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p363: That takes a lot of courage.
p231: I was just a child.

p225: You get a lot for your money.

p283: Our house was very small.

p267: Tiger is not the norm.

p305: It is a vicious circle.
p270: It's not a quick fix.

p362: It's always the way.
p264: All music goes into me.)

p284: We enjoyed it today.

p345: He is the Acting and Deputy First Minister.
p260: We enjoyed it today.

p248: She's got to say something.

p280: They have no real friends in the region.

p376: "So the European elections are extremely important."
p311: Someone else has now got them.
p339: We're very, very happy.
p253: That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.

p306: It is not a definite proposal as yet.
p274: That is far too high.)

p302: The trial is set for February.
p261: It is too pretty, it is too small.

p275: There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.

p239: The error appeared in a warrant.

p374: Paterson was the man.
p307: The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
p247: That might help a bit.)

p243: They have no real friends in the region.

p298: They will know they deserve to be there.
p312: For me, it was a shattering experience.
p237: They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.

p258: I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.

p262: So the European elections are extremely important.

p265: What will happen then?

p245: The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.

p297: The General Election is all to play for.
p232: That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.

p282: That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.

p256: Who would be a referee?

p323: A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
p240: You can spend money on housing.

p277: The mood is upbeat.

p308: The trial is set for February.
p334: It's not one for the purist.
p234: The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.

p303: They will know they deserve to be there.
p273: That would open the gates of hell.

p249: This is the end of a chapter, and it is very sad.

p336: Why does it come out now?
p278: The hearing was due to continue today.

p360: They will run a mile.
p254: The fire was above the hole.

p285: It has removed a bit of guilt.

p295: This is a test of our character.
p250: Prospects for equity markets remain uncertain.

p236: He is a lovely man.

p351: It is a great shame.
p301: The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
p259: That admission is not surprising.)

p361: It is just a statement of fact.
p263: Pupils will be the losers.

p347: Whatever he does, however, it will be decisive.
p241: You can spend money on housing.

p340: Johnsen is equally concerned.
p255: I can't even get into the A team.

p304: It's something he works hard at achieving.
p329: Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
p246: It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.

p341: We are going to go about our lives.
p226: Maybe this battle has been.

p316: It's very ingenious.
p244: In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.

p271: Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.

p343: This decision is destroying my family.
p229: On this showing, they should stick with the lads.

p318: It was a journey into a new life.
p228: The picture is the same across Scotland.

p279: Who would have?

p276: I am not very pleased.

p257: This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.

p292: This would not be my first choice.
p293: This is excellent news for Glasgow.
p227: What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?

p335: The final stage is paranoia.
p299: Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
p252: Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.

p238: What are they for ?

p272: The mood is upbeat.

p266: There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.

122
p288: So the European elections are extremely important.

p269: She has been shot.

p313: It's a way of making a mark.
p300: I will speak to Michael about this.
p314: But the killer remains at large.
p230: Something will be done by corporate bodies.

p287: He is a great addition to our team.

p268: Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.

p294: Did he just want to be on telly?
p233: They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.

p251: She has been shot.

p317: Our home is your home.
p310: His three-year appointment begins on Monday.
p364: This decision is a victory for common sense.
p333: A venue was found.
p281: Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.

p330: Some people still think she should be English.
p286: I'm pleased to get through the opening match.

p326: It is the stop-gap before extinction.
p363: Sadly, it is not to be.
p231: We should not be surprised.

p225: I didn't feel under any pressure.

p283: While they went on holiday, we got the contract.

p267: My conscience is not clear.

p280: England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.

p376: "Death is outside the language."
p311: But once again it was not converted.
p339: There could be a possible connection.
p253: We enjoyed it today.

p306: I will speak to Michael about this.
p274: He said to give a local injection.)

p302: Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
p261: I was on a roll.

p275: Who would have?

p239: They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.

p374: The course is in great condition.
p307: One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
p247: However, the problem is timing.)

p243: England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.

p298: I've got no secret.
p312: This latter suggestion is very important.
p237: It is a delight on every level.

p258: It has removed a bit of guilt.

p262: It was the same at Twickenham.

p265: The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.

p245: What will happen then?

p297: I saw the other car coming, but could do nothing.
p232: The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.

p282: We enjoyed it today.

p256: That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.

p323: However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.
p240: There were no grounds for his action.

p277: It is rubbish.

p308: Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
p334: It may now be too expensive for anyone.
p234: That admission is not surprising.

p303: I've got no secret.
p273: You are a gambling man.

p249: Does this mean.

p336: In that case, the children were not missing.
p278: There will be no shortage of quality applicants.

p360: When she went off it was quite amazing.
p254: This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.

p285: She really suffered for her art.

p295: They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p250
p236: Becoming a father was wonderful.

p351: We were not going to take that risk.
p301: One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
p259: In addition, investor choice is reduced.)

p361: It was on my mind a little bit.
p263: The problem was a social problem.

p347: You can cope with it.
p241: We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.

p340: My body is clearly capable.
p255: Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.

p304: We are taking the back seat on this.
p329: David was not either.
p246: It is not a U-turn.

p341: He had other things on his mind.
p226: Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.

p316: That would depend on the parole board.
p244: He was not alone at the top of the board.

p271: That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.

p343: Why is that?
p229: Maybe this battle has been.

p318: It's a way of making a mark.
p228: Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.

p279: Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.

p276: New Zealand rugby is totally different.

p257: He did his job.

p292: It certainly should not be used too often.
p293: If that is the perception, that has to be addressed.
p227: So, did she meet him ?

p335: I am not holding the club to ransom.
p299: They married in August last year.
p252: Consumers will also benefit.

p238: Is there a waiting list ?

p272: It is rubbish.

p266: Who would have?

123
p288: The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.

p269: I thought it was a fantastic game.

p313: There is a great carry over value.
p300: This is not understood by people outside.
p314: It is a great shame.
p230: We did what we had to do.

p287: I felt he was excellent.

p268: Others may have, but I'm a fighter.

p294: He seems to be used to the attention.
p233: Who would be a referee?

p251: I'm so angry.

p317: It is essential that we win the game.
p310: Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p364: One is too many.
p333: Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
p281: Child abuse is a dreadful thing.

p330: Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
p286: I have learned from him.

p326: That is a data management problem.
p363: Motorists will welcome this.
p231: It was not a finale he would want to remember.

p225: It is the latter which has prompted the warning.

p283: Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.

p267: Nobody in the world can get away from him.

p305: There has been no delay on government orders.
p270: Those people must be accountable.

p362: It will be tight.
p264: It seemed like four hours.)

p284: There were no grounds for his action.

p345: At the moment, the success in Germany is good.
p260: There were no grounds for his action.

p248: We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.

p280: Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.

p376: "Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince."
p311: These figures are truly terrible.
p339: But there was everything!
p253: His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.

p306: This is not understood by people outside.
p274: What happened in that game ?)

p302: Do not go into government buildings.
p261: The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.

p275: That's all right then.

p239: Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.

p374: Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
p307: Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p247: It isn't a happy memory.)

p243: Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.

p298: In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p312: The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
p237: An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.

p258: She does not want to speak.

p232: An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.

p282: His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.

p256: There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.

p277: That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.

p308: Do not go into government buildings.
p334: For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p234: While they went on holiday, we got the contract.

p303: In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p273: It feels like a privilege.

p249: They've got to account for it.

p336: These figures are truly awful.
p278: However, the problem is the timing.

p360: Britain has never had it so good.
p254: We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.

p285: It is not a U-turn.

p295: If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p250: It has been a nightmare of frustration.

p236: I was on a roll.

p351: Last night he became one of the hunted.
p301: Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p259: We had another last Tuesday.)

p361: I will just have to be patient.
p263: Such actions are rarely popular.

p347: It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
p241: I'm so angry.

p340: Yes, we can beat them.
p255: Child abuse is a dreadful thing.

p304: It was a privilege to work for him.

p244: The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.

p271: Who would have?

p343: Well, the big day has arrived.
p229: I'm delighted about that.

p318: There is a great carry over value.
p228: It is so sad.

p279: We work on the same level.

p276: Petrol prices were widely blamed.

p257: You can spend money on housing.

p292: They will run a mile.
p293: Eriksson would have approved.
p227: So what is the campaign about ?

p335: Wagner was never like this.
p299: However, in Scotland this figure was four weeks.
p252: They pointed to the site.

p238: Do they think anyone else wants them ?

p272: That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.

p266: We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.

124
p288: Well, you can have a tree.

p269: Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.

p313: Life, as many people know it, in other words.
p300: I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
p314: There are a lot of examples.
p230: She was also very brave.

p287: We will try to find someone.

p268: We shall rely on human beings.

p294: It's an hour of the same response.
NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p233
p251: It's terrible that he has died the same way.

p317: There was no confusion over the second.
p310: Five in a month isn't good enough.
p364: What can you say?
p333: He said it was the worst possible result.
p281: It has removed a bit of guilt.

p330: Repayment is not part of the game.
p286: I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.

p326: Nor is he allowed out without permission.
p363: I welcome this Bill.
p231: Despite the result, it was still a great moment.

p225: As for the warning, it was not needed.

p283: Our idea is to share and lower the cost.

p267: It would make a lot of sense.

p305: Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p270: I've never seen a game like it.

p362: He seems to be used to the attention.
p264: The family moved around a lot.)

p284: I can't even get into the A team.

p345: It is sad and frustrating.
p260: I can't even get into the A team.

p248: I can't even get into the A team.

p280: In Glasgow, a sheriff dismissed five cases yesterday without hearing evidence.

p376: "Some of the characters will not be played by humans."
p311: This is a most serious matter.
p339: We are doing very well as we are.
p253: Here, again, they were denied a voice.

p306: I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
p274: Are you going to win ?)

p302: There is only one caveat.
p261: My life has changed a lot.

p275: I wouldn't have wanted any other way.

p239: He was just a journalist.

p374: It is too early to speculate.
p307: We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
p247: We have the mental strength.)

NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p243
p298: John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
p312: Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p237: I felt very strongly that England should have it.

p258: It's terrible that he has died the same way.

p262: Our intentions are real.

p265: On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.

p245: He was in a great deal of pain.

p297: United were in control without always being dominant.
p232: That's all right then.

p282: Here, again, they were denied a voice.

p256: The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.

p323: It will also take evidence from consumers.
p240: Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.

p277: There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.

p308: There is only one caveat.
p334: He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.
p234: According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.

p303: John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
p273: That is the ultimate revenge.

p249: Who would have?

p336: The whole thing was just unreal.
p278: This is a frightening development.

p360: So many people will be affected by this.
p254: Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.

p285: Offered the gold medal, he declined.

p295: It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
p250: Before the game we went for a pint.

p236: The abuse of elderly people was appalling.

p351: But that isn't what is worrying the Farmer.
p301: We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
p259: It is too pretty, it is too small.)

p361: I didn't think about it again.
p263: Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.

p347: They will do their own thing.
p241: It has removed a bit of guilt.

p340: She was not hard done by.
p255: His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.

p304: But he admits he is deeply upset.
p329: He wanted someone young and ambitious.
p246: Twaddle is a case in point.

p341: I hadn't seen them in eight years.
p226: This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.

p316: The two sets are different.
p244: While they went on holiday, we got the contract.

p271: We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.

p343: We reckon we can do very well.
p229: I joined a group.

p318: Life, as many people know it, in other words.
p228: It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.

p279: You can spend money on housing.

p276: Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.

p257: That's all right then.

p292: Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p293: You ask the question.
p227: And does it ?

p335: The plane was in flames
p299: Yet he chose to do something different.
p252: Tony Blair said as little.

p238: So what happens next ?

p272: There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.

p266: There were no grounds for his action.

125
p288: I had relied on him.

p269: I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.

p313: I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p300: Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p314: But it will backfire.
p230: On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.

p287: The money needs to go to the front line.

p268: McPherson came from United Biscuits.

p294: We have very real concerns about it.
p233: That's all right then.

p251: Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.

p317: Alan Milburn, the health secretary, refused to comment.
p310: Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
p364: This means that our programme is quite unusual.
p333: Whatever he does, however, it will be decisive.
p281: She does not want to speak.

p330: Who will perform?
p286: The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.

p326: He looked very sharp.
p363: This is not a problem.
p231: That period was a struggle.

NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p225
p283: Sport is good for you.

p267: They could use a boost.

p305: Everyone needs a holiday, even the Salvation Army.
p270: They keep the atmosphere in mind.

p362: Both are national treasures.
p264: We beat the Welsh team.)

p284: She really suffered for her art.

p345: Our intentions are real.
p260: She really suffered for her art.

p248: She does not want to speak.

p280: I think there's not much between them.

p376: "Well, you can have a tree."
p311: I let go the telephone and ran.
p339: The Scots are great.
p253: There were no grounds for his action.

p306: Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p274: Was it the wife ?)

p302: We are still getting signals.
p261: If not, a deal could take many months.

p275: It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.

p239: They lived for their children.

p374: It's up to them.
p307: We aim to put them out of business.
p247: Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.)

p243: I think there's not much between them.

p298: I asked why he had come.
p312: There was some merit in that.
p237: But it took a lot of bottle.

p258: So the European elections are extremely important.

p262: The goals were good.

p265: Is that it?

p245: We want to keep the pound.

p297: Those who are unwilling or unable to improve.
p232: I'm so angry.

p282: There were no grounds for his action.

p256: We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.

p323: I have been to see him.
p240: I was furious.

p277: Who would have?

p308: We are still getting signals.
p334: There is bound to be a formal complaint.
p234: There was a lot of resentment.

p303: I asked why he had come.
p273: I am totally devoted to this job.

p249: The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.

p336: They haven't been thought through.
p278: Which can happen any time.

p360: It was all very good stuff.
p254: I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.

p285: No production was achieved.

p295: The look on his face was something special.
p250: I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.

p236: Something will be done by corporate bodies.

p351: Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
p301: We aim to put them out of business.
p259: The abuse of elderly people was appalling.)

p361: And if they fail?
p263: It isn't a happy memory.

p347: Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
p241: His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.

p340: They said they were only young men.
p255: Next season for every manager is a long time away.

p304: We told them in August.
p329: More patience and composure was required.
p246: I am now unemployed.

p341: Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
p226: She's got to say something.

p316: And now the pressure is off.
p244: We had a great time.

p271: His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.

p343: But it's been kept to a minimum.
p229: It is rubbish.

p318: I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p228: Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.

p279: I felt very strongly that England should have it.

p276: Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.

p257: I was furious.

p292: Britain has never had it so good.
p293: Next league matches, Motherwell Dunfermline.
p227: You've got to be vigilant.

p335: We represent a wide range of society.
p299: He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.
p252: He is at peace with himself.

p238: Had this been common practice ?

p272: Who would have?

p266: I'm so angry.

126
p288: You've got to be vigilant.

p269: His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.

p313: What's the point?
p300: There is a lack of chemistry.
p314: But then he changed his mind.
p230: We must recognise that this outfit is unique.

p287: The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.

p268: On Saturday, it was much the same.

p294: He has gone through the process before.
p233: There were no grounds for his action.

p251: Despite the result, it was still a great moment.

p317: A decision is expected shortly.
p310: This is just one example.
p364: The money all appears to be gone.
p333: This is our way to make our point.
p281: Scottish Life was there over one year.

p330: It's like a high school play.
p286: Maybe this battle has been.

p326: Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
p363: he announced his plans.
p231: It is too pretty, it is too small.

p225: The squad is too small.

p283: It was won on the issue of the land.

p267: He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.

p305: I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
p270: But we could only help a handful of people.

p362: I accept that, but it is very upsetting.
p264: An announcement is expected within a few months.)

p284: It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.

p345: The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
p260: It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.

p248: It's terrible that he has died the same way.

p280: So I am going in the right direction.

p376: "Twaddle is a case in point."
p311: Everyone at the school is delighted for Steven.
p339: That imbalance was evident in their play.
p253: I'm so angry.

p306: There is a lack of chemistry.
p274: Why change it ?)

p302: And perhaps it is as simple as that.
p261: That would open the gates of hell.

p275: She really suffered for her art.

p239: Their season has been consigned to history.

p374: They went to the press.
p307: Tony Blair should get out more.
p247: You can spend money on housing.)

p243: So I am going in the right direction.

p298: Will they ever reopen?
p312: That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p237: I thought it was a fantastic game.

p258: Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.

p262: Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.

p265: It is a time bomb.

p245: Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.

p297: Which brings us to the question of money.
p232: Child abuse is a dreadful thing.

p282: I'm so angry.

p256: There were no grounds for his action.

p323: I try not to expect anything.
p240: His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.

p277: There were no grounds for his action.

p308: And perhaps it is as simple as that.
p334: It is a time bomb.
p234: He wanted to record the group.

p303: Will they ever reopen?
p273: We'll have to think about it.

p249: You can spend money on housing.

p336: They have their own audience in Edinburgh.
p278: It was not a finale he would want to remember.

p360: Or was it?
p254: I joined a group.

p285: He's delighted, too, with the new premises.

p295: You have a very persuasive president.
p250: While they went on holiday, we got the contract.

p236: He said to give a local injection.

p351: In my opinion, it was not working perfectly.
p301: Tony Blair should get out more.
p259: We did what we had to do.)

p361: He has gone through the process before.
p263: When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.

p347: We are in the business of selling tickets.
p241: They keep the atmosphere in mind.

p340: We are in the end game.
p255: We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.

p304: We are going to have a parade.
p329: That's why the young musicians have joined.
p246: She said she would not welcome the flowers.

p341: The next few months will tell.
p226: It is a delight on every level.

p316: You can see the appeal of running away.
p244: I am delighted to have been the captain of the winning side.

p271: The people will come.

p343: It has been a great day.
p229: Who would be a referee ?

p318: What's the point?
p228: Who would be a referee ?

p279: Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.

p276: Many others are subjected to violence by men.

p257: It has removed a bit of guilt.

p292: We are under no illusions about this.
p293: Eriksson, though, was having none of it.
p227: We are amazed that the current trading figures were so weak.

p335: Pig farmers are completely despondent.
p299: There were no casualties.
p252: Gold admitted as much.

p238: What do they want us to do ?

p272: There were no grounds for his action.

p266: It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.

127
p288: The goals were good.

p269: Next season for every manager is a long time away.

p313: Why is this?
p300: I went straight to the toilet.
p314: I really hope he thinks that through.
p230: The opposite is the case.

p287: I miss the freedom that I had.

p268: The Breadwinner came home from Africa.

p294: People will see this over time.
p233: It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.

p246: I was stunned.

p341: Surrey police said no body had been found.

p284: It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.

p345: Edinburgh was not included in the survey.
p260: It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.

p248: It was still there, but right at the end.

p280: But they had to be paid for.

p376: "But we are not immune to the problem."
p311: It is that sort of film.
p339: I have no problem with that.

p237: If the director is with you.

p258: They've got three-quarters of the way.

p262: He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.

p265: This gives a financial incentive to switch.

p245: It's been a good year.

p297: We're trying to get rounded performers.
p232: The conference is the first test.

p282: Is that success?

p256: It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.

p323: It was published yesterday on the internet.
p240: There was no option.

p277: They make a selective perception process.

p308: This must be kept in total perspective.
p334: I'm not changing my mind.
p234: If that's the case, he will struggle.

p303: The Government faces a moral dilemma.
p273: Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.

p246: It's all about money, money, money.

p341: Why does she suddenly win everything now?
p226: Is that it?

p316: There must be boundaries.
p244: I would like to continue to develop.

p271: I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.

p343: Well, you can have a tree.
p229: Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.

p318: This is a really serious issue.
p228: But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.

p279: Our strategy is straightforward.

p276: That admission is not surprising.

p257: We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.

p292: You saw the pain he was in.
p293: It ignores the future.
p227: If the director is with you.

p335: He added,  It is all about the search for power.
p299: I feel privileged to be here.
p252: The hotel was huge.

p238: You are a gambling man.

p272: They make a selective perception process.

p269: The conference is the first test.

p313: So they will settle again.
p300: I like footballers who play well.
p314: Mixing drugs and alcohol can be extremely dangerous.
p230: The result is called a patent.

p287: The sanctions are about collective punishment.

p268: This Patton will also return.

p294: That's been the case for a while.
p233: However, this idea is never developed.

p251: It's the same old story.

p317: That's how she wants to remember him.
p310: Or so we have long assumed.
p364: On recent evidence, he will not be missed.
p333: That certainly brought me back down to earth.
p281: We always felt we could win.

p330: Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
p286: It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.

p326: Everyone knew where they were.
p363: Well, you might have a point.
p231: Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.

p225: And they were being paid ?

p283: The hotel was now for sale.

p267: He had suffered a heart attack.

p305: Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.
p270: Mr Blair was ready for him.

p362: We know the quality of life goes up.
p264: How do you take them away?)

p284: After that time, the market itself will set the prices.

p345: I know my sons.
p260: After that time, the market itself will set the prices.

p248: There would appear to be no motive for the attack.

p280: There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.

p302: All the names are familiar to me.
p261: On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.

p275: On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.

p239: Tiger is not the norm.

p374: Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
p307: Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p247: That could bring the peace process to a standstill.)

p243: There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.

p298: The pressure is on President Bush to deliver.
p312: We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p237: The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.

p258: But she might be.

p262: Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.

p245: The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.

p297: Any error is severely punished.

p234: I could not sit in the stands.

p303: The pressure is on President Bush to deliver.
p273: His injury was completely random.

p360: They are protesting, but they know it cannot go on.
p254: Today was first class.

p285: The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.

p295: My intentions are to go on like this.
p250: He was rejected because he had retired.

p236: It could be argued that the council was pushed to the brink.

p351: We want to play at the worlds.
p301: Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p259: We represent a wide range of society.)

p361: People are trying to run away.
p263: My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.

p347: It's not right of Labour.
p241: On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.

p340: What does that mean?
p255: However, this idea is never developed.

p304: That would be unlawful.
p329: I have a theory.
p246: Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.

p341: What's the big idea?
p226: We live by the rule of law.

p316: However, he was later released without charge.
p244: First and foremost, the game is entirely different.

p271: It is a farce.

p343: Or so it is hoped.
p229: Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.

p318: So they will settle again.
p228: The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.

p279: There would appear to be no motive for the attack.

p276: But he rejected calls for a public register of paedophiles.

p257: IT S all in the hair.

p292: Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
p293: I am just looking to God.
p227: He made no order on costs.

p294: When it is ready, it will be signed.
p233: It's very difficult to find a buyer.

p251: The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.

p310: They responded with victories.
p364: Police have refused to name the couple involved.
p333: Now it has been eclipsed.

p376: "The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring."
p311: Can you believe it?

p268: This action reflects a slump in bookings.

p294: But it was a pleasure.
p233: It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.

p251: Of further privacy, he had no need.

p281: That should be the subject matter of a public debate.

p330: Mentally, you have to be tough.
p286: This idea has been around for four years.

p326: Was it just negligent.
p363: Now we have had enough.

p225: Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.

p283: On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.

p267: We're trying to get rounded performers.

p362: For some, it might not make too much difference.

p292: You've got to have both sides.
p293: Life becomes a song.
p227: This is no reflection on Rangers.

p335: Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.

p339: That sort of thing is long gone.
p253: Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.

p306: The threat to rural areas is real.
p274: I couldn't honestly tell you.)

p302: We have turned the corner.

p336: He denied the charge.
p278: I'd never run for them.

p360: Those were the days.

p340: They've had a good start as well.
p255: Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.

p257: He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.

p292: He should be worried about me.
p293: That, however, is only part of their story.
p227: On the contrary they stand to gain.

p233: She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.

p251: He thought he had a month to cross the street.

p333: We know we can't rely on you.
p281: It is also very valuable.

p330: Who would take it now, after all this?

p363: The gap is closing.
p231: The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.

p362: It has been a major success.
p264: Sales will begin by the end of October.)

p246: In fact, he was talking about the survival business.

p341: I hope my successor will do the same.
p226: He has a wealth of experience.

p316: So, how did this happen?
p244: In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.

p271: He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.

p343: He is not a pathetic figure.
p229: I am an estate agent.

p318: One thing is sure.
p228: We want to see the maximum of change.

p279: They expect the minister to ensure that commitment is honoured.

p276: This might seem like an outrageous assertion.

p261: The offer will run for the next three weekends.

p275: You've got to have both sides.

p298: What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
p312: They were totally behind it.
p237: There is no link.

p258: He has a wealth of experience.

p361: I am really sorry that he is going.
p263: The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.

p347: I am a committed European.

p340: One thing is clear.
p255: He promised to lead from the front in battle for entry.

p304: At the election we will oppose the euro.
p329: I have beaten her a few times.

p226: It happens from time to time.

p316: It's all a part of letting it go.
p244: Obviously, we would want to look at this.

p272: This is a national crisis.

p266: It is not a process which can be completed overnight.

282
p288: Maloney is an engaging talent.

p269: However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.

p313: I'm confident we can do that.
p300: That was merely their initial problem.
p314: We will build upon the basic state pension.
p230: And they were being paid ?

p287: Frankly, we should all have such problems.

p268: A winter of discontent awaits.

p294: For some, it might not make too much difference.
p233: However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.

p251: That's the only thing I will say.

p317: For starters, many of the Scotland team didn't turn up.
p310: I'd never heard him in person before.
p364: It would be dangerous to resign.
p333: It was indeed a night to remember.
p281: Not many companies can say that these days.

p330: Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
p286: That will be a problem for later.

p326: That was enough for the committee.
p363: Other people had looked at it.
p231: That view has not altered.

p225: It was at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow.

p283: Kingfisher can afford to wait.

p267: It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.

p305: Our nation has been changed by this event.
p270: Any error is severely punished.

p339: No other family members could be contacted.
p253: She is an expert on medical ethics.

p306: That was merely their initial problem.

p275: It was a virus.

p239: There is no internal damage.

p374: He did very well, but didn't win.

p258: It's so awful.

p297: Mr Forrester reacted angrily.
p232: The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.

p282: She is an expert on medical ethics.

p256: I saw it at a ruck.

p323: It all changes for her.
p240: However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.

p277: It was good.

p308: I see no need for change.
p334: Military chiefs were playing it straight.
p234: My view has always been the same.

p303: She had been sexually assaulted.
p273: You have to expect this type of thing.

p249: This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.

p336: I watch the other visitors.
p278: These figures are truly terrible.

p360: It was important to bring them all together.
p254: For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.

p285: Yet, it worked.

p295: He's in a lot of pain, it is very distressing.
p250: We are aiming for early March.

p236: Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.

p351: We just wish they had done so before.
p301: The police have an awful lot to explain.
p259: Washington is consumed by the crisis.)

p361: Indeed, that has already begun.
p263: It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.

p347: There are no plans to change this.
p241: Yet, it worked.

p340: We might never see him again.
p255: In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.

p304: As a schoolteacher he was an excellent coach.
p329: He was at home with his pals.
p246: If not, he should go home.

p341: I have been totally taken aback by this.
NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p226
p316: I just hope it's not tonight against us.
p244: On a practical level, it would be difficult.

p271: Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.

p343: Everything is so new.
p229: They were on holiday in Egypt.

p318: I'm confident we can do that.
p228: He was obviously very genuine.

p279: I intended to look for another club on loan.

p276: Sunday's game against Celtic is huge.

p257: A new school will be built.

p292: That was the gimmick.
p293: We very much regret that it has occurred.
p227: It does not work that way in Scottish football.

p335: Arsenal considered the job done.
p299: But when he left, the decision was forced upon us.
p252: Their only score of the half came from a penalty by Jones.

p238: The happiness was slightly misplaced.

p272: It was good.

p266: Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.

283
p288: Who will perform?

p269: In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.

p313: Funding needs to be long term.
p300: I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.
p314: Nothing can bring back their son.
p230: was everything done to save people ?

p287: It was an easy decision to come here.

p268: But no party would win overall control of Scotland.

p294: This is our unfinished business.
p233: I feel pretty good.

p251: That decision is for the British Parliament and people.

p317: The way forward is working with other disciplines.
p310: We're going to change our party.
p364: It is a victory to that extent.
p333: It doesn't appear to be anything too serious.
p281: I realised I was lucky to have it.

p330: I am confident of the outcome this week.
p286: Blair is very positive at European Councils.

p326: We will be homeless.
p363: And the other winners are.
p231: You get a lot for your money.

NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p225

p248: The release attracted little attention.

p280: No-one had seen this sort of thing before.

p376: "He should have won."

p279: You need a licence to run a pub.

p276: And we have the experience.

p257: We are delighted at the response from potential employers.

p278: Is there a waiting list ?

p360: They have brought in the replacement.
p254: The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.

p285: From our point of view, the player is free to leave.

p295: But you can go beyond that condition.
p250: We will listen to any suggestion.

p236: The idea was first mooted a year ago.

p316: It was extremely cold.
p244: The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.

p360: It's something he has worked very hard on.
p254: The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.

p285: They believed it worked.

p295: One Minister said the reports were bizarre.
p250: Is there a waiting list ?

p236: It's only a matter of scale.

p351: What's wrong with that?
p301: He will address the nation this evening.
p259: A Home Office spokesman said.)

p361: He could have given them a lot.
p263: That's as it should be.

p347: And we're talking Big Money.
p241: This is a club on the rise.

p340: He said nothing of the sort.
p255: I have got a wife to feed.

p304: I'd never be satisfied with just the relay.
p329: There may be some evidence to this effect.

p318: It was the same at Twickenham.
p228: It took about an hour for the gas to clear.

p279: So there, we won.

p288: So I left.

p269: Tyson is overwhelmed.

p313: This is an internal matter.
p300: This is not great, but it goes well.

p363: It was great fun.
p231: We live on an island.

p225: There is The Beautiful Game to write.

p283: They were impressive against France.

p267: I am considered a teenager.

p305: It's the curse of our time, irony.
p270: An alternative must be offered.

p362: They went down together.
p264: The purchase was widely criticised by both analysts and investors.)

p284: The pair are very much in love.

p345: It is a road of death.

p298: Would he be able to live with that?
p312: He can do everything.
NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p237
p258: That would help.

p262: Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.

NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p265
NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p245

p278: His views are hardly surprising.

p360: It is time to fight a decisive battle.
p254: There was no option.

p285: We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.

p295: You're not going to get hurt.
p250: In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.

p236: We must put a marker down.

p351: You will never forget the clutching horror.
p301: They have shown a great desire and attitude.

p271: There was a substantial explosion.

p343: Sure, that already happens in New Zealand.
p229: It benefits the whole family.

p318: This is an internal matter.
p228: I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.

p279: By that time, however, it was already too late.

p276: It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.

p257: There were no casualties.

p292: Glasgow is far from overload.
p293: She is believed to be in South Africa.
p227: We are encouraged by the news.

p335: It was a job he loved.

p288: Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.

p314: Now it has become a big picture.

p326: Well, it happened to me, so it's happening to him.
p363: Experience in this work is paramount.
p231: It is not real life.

NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p225
p283: The airport was even different.

p267: There may be reasons for it.

NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p265
NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p245
p297: I was never alone with her, right?
p232: It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.

p282: It is a simple equation.

NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p256
p323: However, who could have predicted this result?
p240: The council said the house would have to be demolished.

p277: So there, we won.

p308: I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p334: It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p234
NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p303
p273: They have broken that promise.

NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p249
p336: He was not alone.

p295: But no decision has been made.
p250: Three years ago he would have been.

p236: She said they would appeal.

p351: Off with their heads.
p301: I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p259: It's too horrible to think.)

p361: It's going to happen.
p263: It is the latter which has prompted the warning.

p347: I was a little surprised.
p241: We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.

p340: It simply doesn't happen.
p255: Not so, it seems.

p304: That's how she wants to remember him.
p329: We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p246
p341: What's happening to her?
p226: This is a club on the rise.

p316: Fishermen are still in a state of confusion.
p244: However, it has to be seen as part of a package.

p271: It's not pretty, but it's effective.

p343: There's a hint of classical.
p229: It was fit for royalty.

p318: I am amazed at what he's done.
p228: It is a simple equation.

p279: Breaking new ground is also very rewarding.

p276: He worked there for six months.

p257: Since then, he has played no active part in the company.

p292: Everything was an effort.
p293: I felt we had fallen back a little.
p227: Had this been common practice ?

p335: It may encourage more people to prospect.
p299: The surprise is its product is so poor.
p252: Still, I am delighted.

p238: William Hague delighted his party.

p272: So there, we won.

p266: Not so, it seems.

365
p288: It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.

p269: But the real problem is the closure of the export market.

p313: They took a risk.
p300: Both are national treasures.
p314: It may encourage more people to prospect.
p230: Alex Ferguson is the same.

p287: He did a good job.

p268: There was an element of frustration.

p294: Such debate is pointless.
p233: But I managed.

p251: The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.

p317: He would help me with the form.
p310: Their mind was already made up.
NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p364
p333: I'm really proud of my young players.

p259: Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.)

p361: I don't think so.
p263: There is a range of employers.

p347: It was a bit like having children.
p241: The play is based on a real-life event.

p340: We wanted to do something different.
p255: Tell it like it was?

p304: There was no disruption to services.
p329: We have been preparing all year.
NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p246
p341: It was to get even better for Motherwell.

p271: Their time has gone.

p276: HARRY Potter has lost his magic.

p257: YOU thought it was a headache.

p292: And does it even matter?
p293: He doesn't even know who he is.
p227: What do they want us to do ?

p335: But let's not get carried away.
p299: I don't have a new house.
p252: Analysts welcomed the news.

p238: His background is firmly in venture capital.

p272: By that time, however, it was already too late.

p266: He was also a great man.

366
p288: It was a double tragedy for the family.

p269: It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.

p313: The idea was presented to me.
p300: And here is the rub.
p314: But let's not get carried away.
p230: George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.

p287: It's a policy which has worked for us.

p268: We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.

p294: And it had two seats.
p233: They play together perfectly.

p317: We could easily be cut again.
p310: I had some time with Aston Villa.
NO UTTERANCE EXISTS FOR SPEAKER: p364
p333: People buy everything with cash.

p363: It is not needed, it should go.
p231: They should take their mobile phones.

p225: It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.

p283: He was at school in Devon.

p267: It's only a matter of scale.

p305: But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
p270: My mind is focused on the next four weeks.

p362: We were getting very worried.
p264: Five local people were injured.)

p284: Mentally, you have to be tough.

p360: It will set the tone.
p254: It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.

p285: It seems a long time ago.

p295: I decided not to renew the contract.
p250: Look at the Liberal Democrats.

p236: It's as wide as a church in here.

p244: In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.

p271: It has only been rumours.

p343: Surely they were on a hiding to nothing.
p229: It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.

p318: The idea was presented to me.
p228: But I managed.

p279: Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.

p276: The business has expanded rapidly, however.

p257: Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.

p292: My parents are exhausted.
p293: This is our chance in Northern Ireland.
